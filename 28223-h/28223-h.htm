<h2 class="chapter">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Fourteen years ago the author came to Quaker Hill as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
resident, and has spent at least a part of each of the intervening
years in interested study of the locality. For ten of those
years the fascination of the social life peculiar to the place
was upon him. Yet all the time, and increasingly of late,
the disillusionment which affects every resident in communities
of this sort was awakening questions and causing regrets. Why
does not the place grow? Why do the residents leave? What
is the illusive unity which holds all the residents of the place
in affection, even in a sort of passion for the locality, yet robs
them of full satisfaction in it, and drives the young and ambitious
forth to live elsewhere?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions is not easily to be had. It
is evident that on Quaker Hill life is closely organized, and
that for eighteen decades a continuous vital principle has given
character to the population. The author has attempted, by
use of the analysis of the material, according to the "Inductive
Sociology" of Professor Franklin H. Giddings, to study
patiently in detail each factor which has played its part in the
life of this community.</p>

<p>This book presents the result of that study, and the author
acknowledges his indebtedness to Professor Giddings for the
working analysis necessary to the knowledge of his problem,
as well as for patient assistance and inspiring interest.
The gradual unfolding of the conclusions, the logical unity of
the whole, and the explanation of that which before was not
clear, have all been the fruit of this patient field-work.</p>

<p>The study of human society is at the present time little
more than a classifying of material. Only with great reserve
should any student announce ultimate results, or generalize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
upon the whole problem. For this period of classifying and
analyzing the material, such study of limited populations as
this should have value. The author makes no apology for the
smallness of his field of study. Quaker Hill is not even a
civil division. It is a fraction of a New York town. Therefore
no statistical material of value is available. It is, moreover,
not now an economic unit, though it still may be considered
a sociological one. This study, therefore, must be of
interest as an analysis of the working of purely social forces
in a small population, in which the whole process may be
observed, more closely than in the intricate and subtle evolution
of a larger, more self-sufficient social aggregate.</p>

<p>The descriptive history of Quaker Hill, which it is my purpose
in this book to write, comprises three periods; and the descriptive
sociology records two differing yet related forms of
social life, connected by a period of transition. This study will
then be made up of three parts: First, the Quaker Community;
second, the Transition; and third, the Mixed Community. The
periods of time corresponding to these three are: The Period
of the Quaker Community, 1730 to 1830; second, the Period of
Transition, 1830 to 1880; and third, the Period of the Mixed
Community, 1880 to 1905.</p>

<p>The Quaker Community, which ran its course in the one
hundred years following the settlement of the Hill, presents
the social history of a homogeneous population, assembled in
response to common stimuli, obedient to one ideal, sharing an
environment limited by nature, cultivating an isolation favored
by the conditions of the time, intermarrying, and interlacing
their relations of mutual dependence through a diversified
industry; knowing no government so well as the intimate
authority of their Monthly Meeting; and after a century suffering
absorption in the commerce and thinking of the time
through increased freedom of communication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The Transition follows the Division of the Quaker Meeting
in 1828, the building of turnpikes, and the coming of the
railroad in 1849. A cultured daughter of Quaker Hill,
whose life has extended through some of those years, has
called them "the dark ages." It was the middle age of the
community. The economic life of the place was undergoing
change, under the penetrating influence of the railroad; the
population was undergoing radical renovation, the ambitious
sons of the old stock moving away, and their places being filled
at the bottom of the social ladder by foreigners, and by immigration
of residents and "summer boarders" of the "world's
people." Above all, the powerful ideal of Quakerism was shattered.
The community had lost the "make-believe" at which
it had played for a century in perfect unity. With it went the
moral and social authority of the Meeting. Two Meetings
mutually contradicting could never express the ideal of
Quakerism, that asserted the inspiration of all and every man
with the one divine spirit. This schism, too, was not local,
but the Monthly Meeting on the Hill was divided in the same
year as the Yearly Meeting in New York, the Quarterly
Meetings in the various sections, and the local Monthly Meetings
throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The Period of the Mixed Community, from the building
of Akin Hall and the Mizzen-Top Hotel in 1880 to the year
1905 has been studied personally by the present writer; and
it is his belief that during this short period, especially from
1890 to 1900, the Hill enjoyed as perfect a communal life as
in the Period of the Quaker Community. The same social
influence was at work. An exceptionally strong principle of
assimilation, to be studied in detail in this book, which made of
the original population a century and a half earlier a perfect
community, now made a mixed population of Quakers, Irish
Catholics and New York City residents, into a community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
unified, no less obedient to a modified ideal, having its leaders,
its mode of association, its peculiar local integrity and a certain
moral distinction.</p>

<p>This period appears at the time of this writing, in 1907,
to be coming slowly to an end, owing to the death of many
of the older members of the Quaker families, and the swift
diminution&mdash;with their authority removed&mdash;of the Quaker influence,
which was the chief factor in the community's power
of assimilation.</p>

<p>If one may state in condensed form what this study discovers
in Quaker Hill that is uncommon and exceptional, one
would say that the social peculiarity of the Hill is: first, the
consistent working out of an idea in a social population, with
the resultant social organization, and communal integrity;
and second, the power of this community to assimilate individuals
and make them part of itself.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE LOCALITY.</h3>


<p>In the hill country, sixty-two miles north of New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and twenty-eight miles east of the Hudson River at Fishkill,
lies Quaker Hill. It is the eastern margin of the town of
Pawling, and its eastern boundary is the state line of Connecticut.
On the north and south it is bounded by the towns
of Dover and Patterson respectively; on the west by a line
which roughly corresponds to the western line of the Oblong,
that territory which was for a century in dispute between the
States of New York and Connecticut. Its length is the north
and south dimension of Pawling.</p>

<p>This area is six and a half miles long, north and south,
and irregularly two miles in width, east and west. Quaker
Hill can scarcely be called a hamlet, because instead of a
cluster of houses, it is a long road running from south to
north by N. N. E. and intersected by four roads running from
east to west. The households located on this road for one
hundred and sixty years constituted a community of Quakers
dwelling near their Meeting House; and until the building of
the Harlem Railroad in the valley below in 1849, had their
own stores and local industries.</p>

<p>Before the railroad came, Quaker Hill was obliged to go
to Poughkeepsie for access to the world, over the precipitous
sides of West Mountain, and all supplies had to be brought
up from the river level to this height. At present Quaker Hill,
in its nearest group of houses at the Mizzen-Top Hotel, is
three miles and three-quarters from the railroad station at
Pawling. Other houses are five and seven miles from Paw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>ling.
On the east the nearest station of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad, New Milford, is nine miles
away. The "Central New England" Branch of the N. Y. N.
H. &amp; H., running east and west, is at West Patterson or
West Pawling, seven and eight miles.</p>

<p>The natural obstacle which does more than miles to isolate
Quaker Hill is its elevation. The "Mizzen-Top Hill," as it
is now called, is a straightforward Quaker road, mounting
the face of the Hill four hundred feet in a half-mile. The
ancient settler on horseback laid it out; and the modern wayfarer
in hotel stage, carriage or motor-car has to follow.
Quaker Hill is conservative of change.</p>

<p>The mean elevation is about 1,100 feet above the sea. The
highest point being Tip-Top, 1,310 feet, and the lowest point
620 feet. The Hill is characterized by its immediate and
abrupt rise above surrounding localities, being from 500 to
830 feet above the village of Pawling, in which the waters
divide for the Hudson and Housatonic Rivers. On its highest
hill rises the brook which becomes the Croton River. From
almost the whole length of Quaker Hill road one looks off
over intervening hills to the east for twenty-five miles, and to
the west for forty miles to Minnewaska and Mohonk; and to
the north fifty and sixty miles to the Catskill Mountains.</p>

<p>One's first impressions are of the green of the foliage and
herbage. The grass is always fresh, and usually the great
heaving fields are mellowed with orange tints and the masses
of trees are of a lighter shade of green than elsewhere. The
qualities of the soil which have made Quaker Hill "a grass
country" for cattle make it a delight to the eye. Well watered
always, when other sections may be in drought, its natural
advantages take forms of beauty which delight the artist and
satisfy the eye of the untrained observer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hill is a conspicuous plateau, very narrow, extending
north and south. It is "the place that is all length and no
breadth." Six miles long upon the crest of the height runs
the road which is its main thoroughfare, and was in its first
century the chief avenue of travel. Crossing it at right angles
are four roads, that now carry the wagon and carriage traffic
to the valleys on either side; which since railroad days are the
termini of all journeys. The elevation above the surrounding
hills and valleys is such that one must always climb to attain
the hill; and one moves upon its lofty ridge in constant sight
of the distant conspicuous heights, the Connecticut uplands
east of the Housatonic on one side, and on the other, the
Shawangunk and Catskill Mountains, west of the Hudson,
all of them more than 25 miles away.</p>

<p>Unsheltered as it is, the locality is subject to severe
weather. The extreme of heat observed has been 105 degrees;
and of cold&mdash;24 degrees.</p>

<p>Quaker Hill possesses natural advantages for agriculture
only. No minerals of commercial value are there; although
iron ore is found in Pawling and nearby towns. On the confines
of the Hill, in Deuell Hollow, a shaft was driven into the
hillside for forty feet, by some lonely prospector, and then
abandoned; to be later on seized upon and made the traditional
location of a gold mine. The Quaker Hill imagination
is more fertile and varied than Quaker Hill land. No commercial
advantages have ever fallen upon the place, except those
resultant from cultivation of the fertile soil in the way of
stores, now passed away; and the opportunity to keep summer
boarders in the heated season.</p>

<p>Interest which attaches to Quaker Hill is of a three-fold
sort: historical, scenic and climatic. The locality has a history
of peculiarly dramatic interest. It is beautiful with a
rare and satisfying dignity and loveliness of scene; and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the choice central spot of a region bathed in a salubrious atmosphere
which has had much to do with its social character
in the past, and is to-day very effective in making the place
a summer settlement of New York people. The population
is increased one hundred per cent. in the summer months,
the increase being solely due to the healthful and refreshing
nature of the place.</p>

<p>The history of the locality is associated with the quaint
name, "The Oblong." This was the name of a strip of land,
lying along the eastern boundary of New York State, now
part of Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties, and narrowing
to the northward, which was for a century in dispute
between New York and Connecticut.</p>

<p>There had been a half century in which this was all disputed
land, between the Dutch at New York and the English
in New England. Then followed a half century of dispute
as to the boundary between sister colonies, which are now
New York and Connecticut. As soon as this was settled in
1731 the immigration flowed in, and the history of Quaker Hill,
the first settlement in the Oblong, begins. It was granted to
New York; and in compensation the lands on which Stamford
and Greenwich stand were granted to Connecticut after
a long and bitter dispute. The end of the dispute and the first
settlement of the Oblong came, for obvious reasons, in the
same year. The first considerable settlement of pioneers was
made at Quaker Hill in 1731, by Friends, who came from
Harrison's Purchase, now a part of Rye.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The historical interest of the locality dwells in the contrast
between the simple annals of Quakerism, which was prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ticed
there in the eighteenth century, and the military traditions
which have fallen to the lot of peaceful Quaker Hill.
The "Old Meeting House," known for years officially as Oblong
Meeting House, experienced in its past, full of memories
of men of peace, the violent seizures by men of war. That
storied scene, in the fall of 1778, when the Meeting House
was seized for the uses of the army as a hospital,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has lived
in the thoughts of all who have known the place, and has
been cherished by none more reverently than by the children
of Quakers, whose peace the soldiers invaded. Both the soldier
and the Quaker laid their bones in the dust of the Hill.
Both had faith in liberty and equality. The history of
Quaker Hill in the eighteenth century is the story of these
two schools of idealists, who ignored each other, but were
moved by the same passion, obeyed the same spirit. It is said
that a locality never loses the impression made upon it by its
earliest residents. Certain it is that the roots of modern things
are to be traced in that earliest period, and through a continuous
self-contained life until the present day.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century Quaker Hill was the chosen asylum
of men of peace. Yet it became the rallying place of
periodic outbursts of the fighting spirit of that warlike age;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>and it was invaded during the great struggle for national
independence by the camps of Washington.</p>

<p>There is a dignity common to Washington battling for
liberty, and the Quaker pioneers serenely planning seven years
before the Revolution for the freedom of the slave. But he
was a Revolutionist, they were loyal to King George; he was
a man of blood, brilliant in the garb of a warrior, and they
were men of peace, dreaming only of the kingdom of God.
He was fighting for a definite advance in liberty to be enjoyed
at once; they were set on an enfranchisement that involved
one hundred years; and a greater war at the end than his
revolution. Their records contains no mention of his presence
here, though his soldiers seized and fortified the Meeting
House.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His letters never mention the Quakers, neither their
picturesque abode, their dreams of freedom for the slave, nor
their Tory loyalty.</p>

<p>Each cherished his ideal and staked his life and ease and
happiness upon it. Each, after the fashion of a narrow age,
ignored the other's adherence to that ideal. To us they are
sublime figures in bold contrast crossing that far-off stage:
Washington, booted, with belted sword, spurring his horse
up the western slope of the Hill, to review the soldiers of the
Revolution in 1778; and Paul Osborn, Joseph Irish and Abner
Hoag, plain men, unarmed save with faith, riding their plough
horses down the eastern slope in 1775, to plead for the freedom
of the slave at the Yearly Meeting at Flushing.</p>

<p>What effect the beauty of the place had upon the pioneer
settlers it is, of course, impossible to say, for they have left
no record of their appreciation of its beauty. Probably their
interest in the picturesque was the same as that of a Quaker
elder, of fine and choice culture after the Quaker standards,
who said to the author, with a quiet laugh: "People all say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>that the views from my house are very beautiful, and I suppose
they are; but I have lived here all my life, and I have
never seen it." A Quakeress confessed to the same indifference
to the beauty of the Hill, until she had resided
for a time in another state, and had mingled with those who
had a lively sense of beauty of scene; returning thereafter to
the Hill, it appeared beautiful to her ever afterward.</p>

<p>The land has been for several generations under a high
state of cultivation. The keeping of many cattle has enriched
the broad pastures; and the dairy industry has been
carried on with constant fertilizing of the lands; so that the
great fields, heaping up one upon another, high above the
valley, and plunging down in steep slopes so suddenly that
the falling land is lost from view and the valley below seems
to hang unattached, are covered with a brilliancy of coloring
and a variety of those rich tints of green and orange which
spell to the eye abundance, and arouse a keen delight, like that
of possessing and enjoying.</p>

<p>There is also a large dignity in the outlines of every scene,
which constantly expands the sensations and gives, on every
hand, a sense of exhilaration and a pleasurable excitement to
the emotions, which seems in experience to have something to
do with the industry and application characteristic of Quaker
Hill.</p>

<p>With this the atmosphere has had much to do, no doubt,
being dry and soft. The first sensation of one alighting from
a train in the town is one of lightness and exhilaration. This
sensation continues through the first hours of one's stay on
the Hill.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> After the first day of exhilaration come a day or
more of drowsiness, with nights of profound sleep. In some
persons a heightened nervousness is experienced, but in most
cases the Hill has the effect upon those who reside there of a
steady nervous arousal, a pleasure in activity, and a keen
interest in life and work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the early settlers, in selecting the highest ground
in this region, had a sense of this excellence of the climatic
effect we do not know; but their descendants believe that
such was their reason for settling the highest arable land on
the Hill before the valleys or the lower slopes were cleared.</p>

<p>It is the common tradition that they settled on the Hill first,
and on its highest parts, in order to avoid the malaria of the
lowlands; as well as because they thought the hill lands to be
more fertile.</p>

<p>The excellence of the climate is witnessed in the long lives
of its residents. There were living in 1903, in a population
of four hundred, five persons, each of whom was at least ninety
years of age; and fifteen, each of whom was more than seventy-five
years of age.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ASSEMBLING OF THE QUAKERS.</h3>


<p>The social mind of the Quaker Hill population was formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
at the settlement of the place, in a common response to common
stimuli. The population was congregated from Long
Island and Massachusetts settlements, by the tidings of the
opening of this fertile land of the Oblong for settlement in
1731. I infer from the fact that settlements were previously
made on both sides, at Fredericksburgh on one side, and at
New Milford on the other,&mdash;at New Milford there was a
Quaker Meeting established in 1729, fifteen years before
Quaker Hill&mdash;that the value of the lands in the Oblong was
well advertised. From the fact noted by James Wood (The
Purchase Meeting, p. 10) that "the first settlement in any
considerable numbers was upon Quaker Hill in the Oblong,"
I infer that the uncommon promise of this hill land had been
made known to the Quakers then assembling at this "Purchase
in the Rye Woods," and that Quaker Hill was settled
in response to the stimulus of valuable, fertile lands offered for
occupation and ownership.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the desire of the first settlers to form a
community where they could live apart, maintain their
form of religion and possess land fertile and rich. The Quakers
are always shrewd as to economic affairs, and the business motive
is never lost sight of in the spiritual inner light. In choosing
Quaker Hill soil they selected ground which after one hundred
and sixty-seven years is the richest in the region, sustains the
best dairies, and is able longer than any other in the neighborhood
in time of drought to afford abundant green grass and
verdure.</p>

<p>To this place thus secluded, came Benjamin Ferriss in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
1728, and Nathan Birdsall. They settled upon the sites
marked 31 and 39; which are 1,200 and 1,100 feet above the
sea, and very near the highest ground for many miles. There
was at this time, 1729, a meeting of Friends at New Milford,
nine miles away; but these two men came from Purchase Meeting
in the town of Rye, forty miles directly to the South. There
soon followed others, bearing the names, Irish, Wing, Briggs,
Toffey, Akin, Taber, Russell, Osborn, Merritt, Dakin, Hoag.
In ten years the tide of settlement was flowing full. In
forty years the little community was filled with as many
as could profitably find a living.</p>

<p>Complete records of the sources of this immigration are not
available. John Cox, Jr., Librarian of the Yearly Meeting of
Friends, says "the records do not show in any direct way
where the members came from. A few came from Long
Island meetings by way of Purchase, but most of them from
the East, and I believe from Massachusetts. Indirectly the
records show that the members occasionally went on visits
into New England, and took certificates of clearance there
(to marry)." Dartmouth, Mass., a town between Fall River
and New Bedford, was the original home of so many of them
that it easily leads all localities as a source of Quaker Hill ancestry.
The Akin, Taber, Briggs families came from Dartmouth,
which was in a region of both temporary and permanent
Quaker settlement. Quaker Hill, R. I., is within fifteen
miles of Dartmouth. The residents of Quaker Hill, New
York, preserve traditions of the returns of the early Friends
"to Rhode Island." There is a Briggs family tradition of the
first pair of boots owned on the Hill, which were borrowed in
turn by every man who made a visit to the ancestral home at
Dartmouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It is probable also that some of the original residents came
from Long Island, though from what localities I do not know.
The minutes of Purchase Meeting at Rye, through which
meeting most of the Quaker Hill settlers came, indicate in only
a limited number of cases that the immigrant came from a farther
point; and leave the impression that the Friend so commended
to the Oblong was already a resident of "the Purchase,"
or of its related meetings at Flushing on Long Island.
An example is the case of William Russell and his wife, notable
pioneers, the earliest residents of Site 25, whose letter from
Purchase Meeting in 1741 indicates only that they came to
Oblong from Purchase.</p>

<p>The settlement of the Hill continued from the early years,
1728-1731, at which it began, until 1770, when the community
may be said to have been complete. The land was supporting
by that time all it would bear. Since that time the number of
houses on the Hill has remained about the same, as will be
seen from a comparison of the Maps 1 and 2, the one made
for Washington in 1778-80 and the other being a tracing of
the map of the Topographical Survey of the United States
Government of recent date.</p>

<p>The extent of this population resident upon the Hill is
shown in the lists of persons whose names appear in Appendix
A, which is a census of the heads of families in the Meeting
in the year 1761; added to which is a list of names which appear
in the minutes of the Meeting in years immediately following.
These lists show the growth of the population under
study, in the years from 1761 to 1780, for there are whole
families omitted from the list of 1761, who are named in the
minutes in succeeding years. An instance is that of Paul and
Isaac Osborn, who came from Rhode Island in 1760.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p><p>As this list of members of the meeting shows the actual
size of the population resident upon the Hill in 1761, the other
list published in Appendix B, containing the names of those
who traded at the Merritt store in 1771, exhibits, with startling
vividness, the importance of Quaker Hill at that time. Little
as the place is now, and geographically remote and hard of
access always, it was evidently in the years named a center
of a far-reaching country trade. This list is published in full,
exactly as the names appear on Daniel Merritt's ledger, to
convey this impression; and by contrast, the impression of the
shrinkage in the years since the railway changed the currents
of trade. It is published also as a basis of this study, being
a numerical description, in the rough, of the problem we are
studying. And a third use which such a list may serve is that
of information to those interested in genealogy. It is a veritable
mine of information, suggestion, and even color, of the
life of that time&mdash;as indeed are the ancient ledgers, bound in
calf, and kept with exquisite care, by this colonial merchant.
In these old records are suggested, though not described, the
lives of a hard-working, prosperous population, filling the
countryside, laying the foundations of fortunes which are
to-day enriching descendants. It was a community without
an idler, with trades and occupations so many as to be independent
of other communities, hopeful, abounding in credit,
laying plans for generations to come, and living bountifully,
heartily from day to day.</p>

<p>Every item in these mercantile records is of interest and
full of suggestion, from the names of the negro slaves, who
had accounts on the books, to the products brought for sale
by one customer after another, by which they liquidated their
accounts; from the "quart of rum" bought by so many with
every "trading," to the Greek Testament and Latin Grammar
bought by solid Thomas Taber, who wrote his name in real
estate by his thrift and force, if he did not write it in dead
languages.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE QUAKER COMMUNITY.</h3>


<p>The economic activity of the early Quaker Community was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
varied. All they consumed they had to produce and manufacture.
Though the stores sold cane sugar, the farmers made
of maple sap in the spring both sugar and syrup, and in the fall
they boiled down the juice of sweet apples to a syrup, which
served for "sweetness" in the ordinary needs of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Every man was in some degree a farmer, in that each
household cultivated the soil. On every farm all wants had to
be supplied from local resources, so that mixed farming was
the rule. The land which its modern owners think unsuited
to anything but grass, because it is such "heavy, clay soil,"
was made in the 18th century to bear, in addition to the
grass for cattle and sheep, wheat, rye, oats and corn, flax,
potatoes, apples. Of whatever the farmer was to use he must
produce the raw material from the soil, and the manufacture
of it must be within the community.</p>

<p>Two lists which come to us from early days cast light on
the population and occupations of the early period. One is
the sheriff's list of landowners in Dutchess County in 1740,
on which is no name of any farmer then resident on Quaker
Hill. The other list is that of those who claimed exemption
from military duty in 1755; 38 are from Oblong and 21 from
Beekman, many of them being Quakers resident on the Oblong.
This list is as follows:</p>

<p>Joshua Shearman, Beekman Prec'nt, shoemaker; Moses
Shearman, Beekman Prec'nt, laborer; Daniel Shearman, Beekman
Prec'nt, laborer; Joseph Doty, Beekman Prec'nt, black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>smith;

<p>This list mentions six occupations: the farmer, blacksmith,
tailor, shoemaker, carpenter and laborer. With these six a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
frontier community could live, for every man of them was a
potential butcher, tanner, trader. There is record of others
in later years, when the communal life had become differentiated.
There were at various times in the Quaker century
stores at four places on the Hill. The Merritt store, at Site
28, descended to the sons of Daniel Merritt, and finally
to James Craft. There was a store in Deuell Hollow, kept by
Benjamin and Silas Deuell for several years. There is extant
one bill of merchandise purchased by them of Edward and
William Laight, merchants of New York, the amount being
£200 and the date Feb. 25, 1785. The Akin stores at Sites 47
and 46, were kept by Daniel and Albro Akin, and the store
at Site 53, by John Toffey. These stores during the period of
the Quaker community were in trade largely by barter, taking all
the commodities the farmer had beyond his immediate use, and
selling sugar, coffee, cloth and other commodities which after
1815, as will be shown later, rapidly increased in number and
in quantity. The use of money increased at the same period.
The phrase still lingers in Quaker Hill speech: "I am going
to the store to do some trading," though the milk farmer has
engaged in no barter for fifty years.</p>

<p>In the culminating period of the Quaker Community, which
followed the Revolutionary War, the following were some of
the occupations practiced on the Hill, the record or remembrance
of which is preserved:<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Abram Thomas was a blacksmith, at Site 14,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and is said
to have made the nails used in building the Meeting House.
George Kirby, at Site 99½, had a blacksmith shop; there was
another at Site x100, now abandoned on Burch Hill, kept by
Joel Winter Church, where Washington's charger was shod,
and the bill was paid at the close of the war.</p>

<p>But the most notable smithy was at Site 41, where now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>stands one of the oldest houses on the Hill. Here Davis
Marsh wrought in iron, and the sound of his trip-hammer
audible for miles smote its own remembered impression upon
the ears of those ancient generations. Doubtless the favored
location of Marsh's shop in the neighborhood most central,
as is shown in Chapter III, Part III, gave it greater use.
There was at one time a forge in the Glen at Site 66, to which
magnetic ore was hauled from Brewster to be worked.</p>

<p>A "smith shop" is also noted on Erskine's map for Washington
in 1778 at Site x111. The most important manufacturing
business of the community, however, was the
wagon-worker's shop at Site 45, kept by Hiram Sherman. Under
the general title of wagon maker he manufactured all movables
in wood and iron, from fancy wagons to coffins.</p>

<p>Other trades were of increasing variety as the century of
isolation proceeded. Shoemakers went from house to house
to make shoes for the family, of the leather from the backs
of the farmer's own cattle, tanned on the farm or not far
away. Reed Ferris was a shoemaker, in whose residence at
Site 99 Washington was entertained in September, 1778, until
he took up Headquarters at John Kane's. Stephen Riggs was
a shoemaker. Three tanneries were maintained on the Hill
in the bloom of the Quaker community by Ransom Aldrich
about Site 13; Amos Asborn, at Site x21, who also made
pottery there; and Isaac Ingersoll, at Site 134.</p>

<p>Albro Akin had a sawmill in the Glen, and a gristmill was
also located there in an early period. William Taber had a
gristmill and also a cloth mill, consisting of carding machine,
fulling mill, and apparatus for pressing, coloring and dressing
cloth. John Toffey, at Site 53, and Joseph Seeley, at Site 15,
and some of the Arnolds, near Site 12, were hatters. Jephtha
Sabin, at Site 74, and Joseph Hungerford were saddlers and
harnessmakers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Every farmer and indeed every householder raised hogs.
Pork was salted, as it is to-day, for winter use, in barrels of
brine. Hogs also were extensively raised and butchered for
market, at a year and a half old, the meat being taken to
Poughkeepsie by wagon, and thence to New York. Many
who raised more pork than their own use demanded exchanged
it at the stores. Fields of peas were raised to feed
the hogs.</p>

<p>Sheep also were raised for their wool; their meat afforded
an acceptable variety in farmer's fare and their hides had
many uses. David Irish, Daniel and David Merritt, Jonathan
A. Taber and George P. Taber were farmers whose product
of wool was notably fine and abundant. Jonathan Akin
Taber "kept about eleven hundred sheep, some merino and some
saxony."</p>

<p>Butter and cheese making were an important part of the
business and income of the farmer's family, the butter being
packed and sent weekly to the Hudson River boats for New
York markets, or to Bridgeport or New Haven&mdash;a two-days'
journey in either case. The cheese was ripened, or cured,
being rubbed and turned every day, and kept until the dealers
came around to inspect and purchase. On every farm was
kept a flock of geese, which were picked once in six weeks to
keep up the supply of feather beds and to furnish the requisite
number for the outfit of each daughter of the family.</p>

<p>In the year 1767, Oblong Meeting took action which resulted,
after seven years of agitation, in the clear declaration
by the Yearly Meeting of New York, earliest of such acts,
in favor of the freeing of slaves. This was one hundred years
before the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p>Wilson's "Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America"
says that "Members of the Society of Friends took the lead in
the opposition to slavery." There had been action taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
1688 by a small body of Germantown Quakers, in the form of
a petition to their Yearly Meeting against "buying, selling and
holding men in slavery." But to this the Yearly Meeting,
after eight years of delay, replied only that "the members
should discourage the introduction of slavery, and be careful
of the moral and intellectual training of such as they held in
servitude."</p>

<p>Meantime the Quaker Meetings on Long Island, in New
York and Philadelphia took action recognizing slavery, with
only a gradual tendency to regard the institution of slavery
with disfavor. Now the time had come for putting the denomination
in array against the institution.</p>

<p>There was a preacher of the Quakers who traveled much
from 1746 to 1767 through the colonies, proclaiming that
"the practice of continuing slavery is not right;" and that
"liberty is the natural right equally of all men." In the last
year of his propaganda occurred the event notable in local
history. This was thirteen years before the action of the
State of Pennsylvania, which initiated the lawmaking for
emancipation among the northern colonies. It was "twenty
years before Wilberforce took the first step in England
against the slave-trade." The record of this action is as
follows:</p>

<p>"At a (Yearly) Meeting at the Meeting House at Flushing
the 30th day of the 5th month, 1767, a Querie from the Quarterly
Meeting of the Oblong in Relation to buying and Selling
Negroes was Read in this meeting and it was concluded to be
left for consideration on the minds of friends until the Next
Yearly Meeting. The Query is as follows: It is not consistent
with Christianity to buy and Sell our Fellowmen for
Slaves during their Lives, &amp; their Posterities after them, then
whether it is consistent with a Christian Spirit to keep those
in Slavery that we have already in possession by Purchase,
Gift or any otherways."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The year after, not without due hesitation, a committee
was appointed which "drew an Essay on that subject which
was read and approved and is as follows: We are of the mind
that it is not convenient (considering the circumstances of
things amongst us) to give an Answer to this Querie, at least
at this time, as the answering of it in direct terms manifestly
tends to cause divisions and may Introduce heart burnings
and Strife amongst us, which ought to be Avoided, and Charity
exercised, and persuasive methods pursued and that which
makes for peace. We are however fully of the mind that
Negroes as Rational Creatures are by nature born free, and
where the way opens liberty ought to be extended to them,
and they not held in Bondage for Self ends. But to turn
them out at large Indiscriminately&mdash;which seems to be the
tendency of the Querie, will, we Apprehend, be attended with
great Inconveniency, as some are too young and some too old
to obtain a livelihood for themselves."</p>

<p>Here, then, is the first action in a legislative body in New
York State, upon the freeing of slaves. The "Querie from
Oblong" had secured a clear deliverance in favor of the essential
right of the negro as a man, in favor of his being freed
"where the way opened," and against the holding of man for
the service of another. The only hesitation of the meeting was
frankly stated; emancipation was not to be pushed to the
point of division among Christians, and was not to be accomplished
to the impoverishment of the negro.</p>

<p>Yet if this action seems to any one like "trimming," it was
followed by other deliverances increasingly clear and emphatic.
Three years later Friends were forbidden to sell their
slaves, except under conditions controlled by the Meeting.
Throughout the communities of Friends the agitation was being
carried on, and the meetings were anxious to purge themselves
of the evil.</p>

<p>Finally in 1775 came the clear utterance of the Yearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Meeting in favor of emancipation without conditions: "it
being our solid judgment that all in profession with us who
hold Negroes ought to restore to them their natural right to
liberty as soon as they arrive at a suitable age for freedom."
At this meeting the Oblong was represented by Joseph Irish,
Abner Hoag and Paul Osborn.</p>

<p>It only remains to picture the rest of the process by which
slavery was purged away on Quaker Hill. In 1775 the practice
of buying and selling slaves had come to an end, and no
public abuse was noted by the Meeting in the treatment accorded
to slaves by their masters. The next year there was
but one slave owned by a member of the Meeting; and the day
he was freed in the fall of 1777 was counted by the Meeting
so notable that the clerk was directed to make a minute of the
event. The owner had been Samuel Field, and the slave was
called Philips. Another manumission in 1779 is recorded, but
it was doubtless in the case of a new resident of the Hill, for
it is recorded without signs of the joy exhibited in the freedom
of Philips.</p>

<p>In the years 1782-3 the final act in emancipating the local
slaves was taken, in the investigation by a committee of the
Meeting into the condition of the freed slaves, and the obligations
of their old masters to them. It was not very cordially
received at first, but in the third year of the life and labors of
the committee it was reported by them that "the negroes appear
to be satisfied without further settlement." So the first
American community to free herself from slavery required but

<h3 class="chapter2">AMUSEMENTS IN THE QUAKER COMMUNITY.</h3>


<p>The Quaker community had little time for amusements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and less patience. The discipline of the Meeting
levelled its guns at the play spirit, and for a century men were
threatened, visited, disowned if necessary, for "going to frollicks,"
and "going to places of amusement." The Meeting
House records leave no room for doubt as to the opinion held
by the Society of Friends upon the matter of play.</p>

<p>An account is given elsewhere of the discipline of the
Meeting in its struggle against immorality and "frollicking."
The following quotation from James Woods' "The Purchase
Meeting," vividly depicts the confused elements of the social
life of that time: "On great occasions such as the holding
of a Quarterly Meeting, the population turned out <i>en masse</i>.
Piety and worldliness both observed the day. The latter class
gathered about the meeting house, had wrestling matches and
various athletic sports in the neighboring fields, and horse
races on the adjacent roads. The meetings regularly appointed
committees as a police force to keep order about the
meeting house during the time of worship and business."</p>

<p>The stories told by old Quaker Hill residents of the gatherings
about the meeting house, even on First Day, or Sunday,
confirm the above quotation. The field opposite the meeting
house, for years after 1769, when the earliest meeting house
was moved away from that site, was used as a burial
ground, and later, no headstones being placed in those early
days, as a space for tethering horses. An old resident tells
me that crowds of men were always about the meeting house
before and after meeting, and even during meeting, and that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
later years the resident of Site No. 32, who owned valuable
horses, used to exhibit a blooded stallion on a tether, leading
him up and down to the admiration of the horse-owners present,
and to their probable interest.</p>

<p>These conditions seem to have continued through that
whole century. The play spirit had no permitted or authorized
occasions. It had to exercise itself with the other
instincts, in the common gatherings. It was, as far as we
can see, a time of asceticism. Men were forbidden rather than
invited, in those days.</p>

<p>The Meeting not only provided no play opportunities, but
it forbade the attendance of its members upon the "frollicks,"
which then were held, as nowadays they are held, in the
country side. A gathering with plenty to eat, and in those
days a free indulgence in drink on the part of the men, with
music of the fiddler, and dancing, this was a "frollick"&mdash;that
horror of the meeting house elders. Indeed, it was of incidental
moral detriment; for it was outlawed amusement, and
being under the ban, was controlled by men beyond the influence
or control of the meeting. The young people of the
Quaker families, and sometimes their elders, yielded to the
fascinations of these gatherings. The unwonted excitement
of meeting, the sound of music, playing upon the capacity for
motor reactions in a people living and laboring outdoors, inflamed
beyond control by rum and hard cider, soon led to
lively, impulsive activities and physical exertions, both in
immoderate excess and in disregard of all the inhibitions of
tradition and of conscience. That there was a close relation of
these "frollicks" with the sexual immorality of the period is
probable.</p>

<p>Of more concern to us here is the observation, which is
made with caution, that the attitude of the community to
amusements was not conducive to moral betterment, because
amusement was not specialized. The repression of the play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
spirit, offering it no occasions, recognizing no times and places
as appropriate for it, disturbed the equilibrium of life, forced
the normal animal spirits of the population to impulsive and
explosive expressions and deprived them of the regulative
control of the community.</p>

<p>It is probable that that early period had modes of amusement
the record of which is wholly lost. There are few sources
existing to inform us of the amusements of laboring classes.
Hints occur in such records as that of the sale of powder and
shot, of fishhooks and a quart of rum, at the Merritt store,
in 1771, to the Vaughns. Seven years later the Vaughns were
the Tory "cowboys," who robbed the defenceless neighborhood,
until their leader was killed by Captain Pearce, during the
Revolution.</p>

<p>It is probable that then the community wore the aspect
which now it wears, of industry without play; and that members
went elsewhere for their amusement, the acknowledged
leaders in which were resident in other neighborhoods and
communities.</p>

<p>The recreation of the body of working population of the
Hill was incidental to the religious assemblies. In these
meetings they took an intense and a very human pleasure.
Their solitary, outdoor labor was performed in an intense atmosphere
of communal interaction. He who raised hogs was
to sell them, not to a distant market, but to Daniel Merritt,
or John Toffey, the storekeepers. He who made shoes went
from house to house, full of news, always talking, always
hearing. He who wove heard not his creaking loom, but the
voice of the storekeeper or of the neighbor to whom he would
sell. The cheeses a woman pressed and wiped in a morning
were to be sold, not far away to persons unseen, but to neighbors
known, whose tastes were nicely ascertained and regarded.</p>

<p>The result was that meetings on First Day and Fourth
Day were times of intense pleasure, occasions of all-around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
interest: not mere business interest, but incidentally a large
satisfaction of the play instinct, especially for the working
and mature persons. The young, too, had their happiness and
enjoyment of one another in a multitude of ways, in addition
to those boisterous games described above by Mr. James
Wood. Their intense friendships and lively enterprises were
probably not so easy to confine to the bounds of sober, staid
meetings, but no less did their merry good spirits fill those
assemblies. The galleries of the old Meeting House were
built in 1800 for the young, who were expected to sit there
during meeting. The wooden curtains between the "men's
part" and the "women's part" are especially thorough in their
exclusion of even an eyeshot from one side to the other.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE IDEALS OF THE QUAKERS.</h3>


<p>In the Introduction to Professor Carver's "Sociology and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Social Progress" is a passage of great significance to one who
would understand Quaker Hill, or indeed any community, especially
if it be religiously organized. The writer refers to:
"a most important psychic factor, namely the power of idealization.
This may be defined, not very accurately, as the power
of <i>making believe</i>, a factor which sociologists have scarcely
appreciated as yet. We have such popular expressions as
'making a virtue of necessity,' which indicates that there is
a certain popular appreciation of the real significance of this
power, but we have very little in the way of a scientific appreciation
of it.</p>

<p>"One of the greatest resources of the human mind is its
ability to persuade itself that what is necessary is noble or
dignified or honorable or pleasant. For example, the greater
part of the human race has been found to live under conditions
of almost incessant warfare. War being a necessity from
which there was no escape, it was a great advantage to be
able to glorify it, to persuade ourselves that it was a noble
calling&mdash;in other words, a good in itself.</p>

<p>"Another example is found in the case of work. Work is
a necessity as imperious as war ever was. Looked at frankly
and truthfully, work is a disagreeable necessity and not a good
in itself. Yet by persuading ourselves that work is a blessing,
that it is dignified and honorable, our willingness to work is
materially increased, and therefore the process of adaptation
is facilitated&mdash;in other words, progress is accelerated. Among
the most effective agencies for the promotion of progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
therefore, must be included those which stimulate this power
of idealization. In short, he who in any age helps to idealize
those factors and forces upon which the progress of his age
depends, is perhaps the most useful man, the most powerful
agent in the promotion of human well-being, even though
from the strictly realistic point of view he only succeeds in
making things appear other than they really are. From the
sociologist's point of view this is the mission of art and
preaching of all kinds."</p>

<p>The quotation from Professor Carver bears the impression
of incompleteness, or rather of suggestiveness. If "making a
virtue of necessity" is idealization, is not symbolism also a
form of "make believe." If the "ability to persuade oneself
that what is necessary is noble or dignified or honorable or
pleasant," is exhibited on Quaker Hill as a "most important
psychic factor," so is also the idealization of the commonplace
the "making believe" that peace and plainness, that simple,
old-fashioned dress, and seventeenth century forms of speech
are spiritual and are serviceable to the believing mind. The
power of idealization is nowhere exhibited as a social force
more clearly than in a Quaker community. Professor Carver's
word, "make believe," is most accurate. Quakers act with all
sincerity the drama of life, using costume and artificial speech,
and attaching to all conduct peculiar mannerisms; casting
over all action a special veil of complacent serenity; all which
are parts in their realization of the ideal of life. Their fundamental
principle is that the divine spirit dwells and acts in the
heart of every man; not in a chosen few, not in the elect
only, but in all hearts. Quaker Hill to this day acts this out,
in that every person in the community is known, thought upon,
reckoned and estimated by every other. Towns on either side
have a neglected population area, but Quaker Hill has none.
Pawling in its other neighborhoods has forgotten roads, despised
cabins, in which dwell persons for whom nobody cares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
drunkards, ill-doers, whom others forget and ignore. Quaker
Hill ignores no one. There are, indeed, rich and poor, but
the former employ the latter, know their state, enjoy their
peculiarities, relish their humor. It has apparently always
been so. Elsewhere I have described the measures taken by
popular subscription to replace the losses suffered by the
humbler members of the community, in the tools of life (see
Chapter VII). It need not be said that the poorer members
bear the rich in mind. Every person resident on the Hill has
come to partake in this sense of the community, this practice
of new Quakerism. No one is out of sight and yet there is
no dream of equality behind this communal sense. It is as
far from a communistic, as from a charitable state of mind.
It is the result of years of belief in common men and common
things.</p>

<p>This "make believe" that commonplace things are the spiritual
things was a corollary of George Fox's life as much as
of his doctrine. He opposed pomp and ritual, salaried priests,
ordinations and consecrations; he disbelieved in "the imposition
of hands." His followers therefore went so far as to find in
plainness a new sanctity. They adapted at once the "plain
garb" of the period of William Penn and Robert Barclay, and
the generations of men who followed felt themselves morally
bettered by a drab coat and breeches, a white neck-cloth, and
a broad-brimmed brown hat; the women by dresses of simple
lines, low tones of color, bonnets of peculiar shape, shielding
the eyes on either side.</p>

<p>Of course in time this exceptional garb by its uniqueness
defeated the very desire George Fox had for "plainness." It
was not commonplace but extraordinary. Roby Osborn's garb
is thus described by her biographer: "Her wedding gown
was a thick, lustreless silk, of a delightful yellowish olive, her
bonnet white. Beneath it her dark hair was smoothly banded,
and from its demure shelter her eyes looked gravely out. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
vest was a fine tawny brown, of a sprigged pattern, both gown
and vest as artistically harmonious as the product of an Eastern
loom. Pieces of both were sewn into a patchwork quilt,
now a family heirloom."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>For more than a century now "plainness in dress" has been
extravagance in dress. A proper Quaker hat for man or
woman costs twice or thrice what plain people of the same
station in life would pay. But be it so. In its day, which is
now gone&mdash;for only one person now wears "plain dress" on
Quaker Hill&mdash;it was a true expression of the "make believe"
of sanctity in plainness. The quiet colors, the prescribed
unworldliness involved a daily discipline, and infused into the
wearer an emotional experience which mere economy and real
commonness would never so continuously have effected.</p>

<p>The "plain speech" has the same effect. It is part of the
same dramatic celebration of an ideal. It is a use of quaint
and antique forms, not grammatically correct nor scriptural,
in which "thee" takes the place of "thou" and you in the
singular, both in the nominative and objective cases. It is
not used with the forms of the verb of solemn style, but with
common forms, as "thee has" instead of "thou hast." Another
element of the "plain speech" is the use of such terms as
"farewell" for "good day"&mdash;which is declared to be untruthful
on bad days! The Quakers also address one another by their
first names, and the old-fashioned Friends addressed everybody
so, refusing to use such titles as "Mr.," "Mrs.," or "Miss."</p>

<p>Of late years the younger members of the Meeting, while
maintaining their standing there, have used with persons not
in the Meeting the ordinary forms of speech, as they have refused
to assume the Quaker plain garb. With fellow-Quakers
and with members of their own families they say "thee."</p>

<p>Before the period of the mixed community this power of
idealization, of "making believe," had wrought its greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
effects, but it still has full course and power without the
highest direction. The minds of the residents of the Hill are
very suggestible; but the persons who have the power to implant
the suggestion are no longer inspired as of old, with a
sublime and unearthly ideal. They are only animated with
an economic one. But the result is the same. It is social,
rather than religious. It was one thing for the early Friends
to cement together a community through the feeling that in
every man was the Spirit of God. A wonderful appetite was
that for the assimilation of new members coming into the
community. It was a doctrine that made all the children birthright
members of the Meeting and so of the community.</p>

<p>But in our later time, between 1895 and 1905, this power
of "making believe" had suffered the strain of a division of the
meeting. It was harder to believe that the Spirit of God was
in all men, when half the community was set off as "unorthodox."
It had suffered the strain of seeing the wide social
difference caused by money. Yet it bravely played the game.
Children are not more adapt at "making believe" than were
these old Friends. They deceived even themselves; and their
"pretending" assimilated into the communal life every newcomer.
For it created underneath all differences a sense of
oneness; it kept alive, in all divisions, many of the operations
of unity. It compelled strangers and doctrinal enemies to
"make believe" to be friends.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to describe this elusive force of the communal
spirit in the place, just as the communal character of
the place is itself evanescent, while always powerful. I know
clearly only this, that it proceeded, and still on Quaker Hill
proceeds from the old religious inheritance, and from the
present religious character of the place; that it tends directly
to the creation of the community of all men, of all different
groups, and that it is ready at hand at all time, to be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to the assistance of anyone who knows how to appeal to that
communal unity; and that it is a power of idealization, meaning
by that "a power of making believe." In this power, I
recognize this community as being more expert and better
versed than any I have ever known.</p>

<p>The dramatic expression of an ideal has had great social
power. Upon the casual observer or visitor it has wrought
with the effect of a charm to impress upon them in a subtle
way the ideal of Quakerism. Expressed in words, it would
have no interest: acted out so quaintly, it awakens admiration,
interest, and imitation, not of the forms, but always in some
degree of the substance of the Quaker ideal.</p>

<p>Thus the Quaker ideal has given authority to the Friends,
especially to the older and more conservative of them; has
furnished a subtle machinery for assimilating new members
into the community and thus has been an organizing power.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">MORALS OF THE QUAKER COMMUNITY.</h3>


<p>From the first the members found themselves subjected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a clear, simple standard of morals. Its dominion was unbroken
for one hundred years, and came to an end with the
Division of the Meeting; though that event was a result as
much as a cause of its termination. For one hundred years
a local ethical code prevailed. While they lived apart the
Quakers in their community life rejoiced in the unbroken
sway of a communal code of morals, the obedience to which
made for survival and economic success. When, with better
roads to Poughkeepsie and to Fredericksburgh, newcomers
began to invade the community; when in 1849 the railroad
came to the neighborhood, immersing the Quakers in the
world economy, the Quaker code was insufficient, retarded
rather than assisted survival, and rather forbade than encouraged<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">success. It therefore lost its force. Only in a few individuals</span><br />
has it survived.</p>

<p>The residents of the Hill, from their earliest settlement in
1728 to the time of the Division in 1828, knew no other
government than that of the Meeting. They accepted no other
authority, hoped for public good through no other agency,
even read no other literature, than that of the Quaker Monthly
Meeting of the Oblong. The religious Meeting House was
also the City Hall, State House, and Legislature for the
patriotism, as it was the focus of the worship and doctrinal
activity of this population. This cannot be stated too strongly,
for there was no limit to its effect. It explains many things
otherwise diverse and unexplained.</p>

<p>During all the periods of war the Quakers showed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
separateness by refusing to pay taxes, lest they contribute to
the support of armies. In the Revolution, the Meeting exercised
unflinching discipline, for the purpose of keeping members
out of the patriot armies, and punished with equal vigor
those who paid for the privilege of exemption from military
duty and those who enlisted in the ranks. In every act of
the discipline of the Quaker Community appears the purpose
of the Meeting, namely, to keep its members to itself and away
from all other moral and spiritual control. This will appear
in definite illustrations below.</p>

<p>The standard of morals which the Meeting thus upheld
with jealous care was a simple one, and logically derived from
the distinctive doctrine of the Society of Friends. That the
Spirit of God dwells in every man was their belief,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and from
1650, when Fox was called "a Quaker" before Justice Bennett
at Derby, England, to the Division in 1830, they applied this
doctrine in practical, rather than in metaphysical ways. They
were a moral, rather than a theological people. It will appear in
this chapter that only when the moral grip of the Meeting
was broken in a division did doctrinal questions come to discussion
on the Hill.</p>

<p>The moral bearing of the one cardinal doctrine of Quakerism
is well expressed in the following quotation from a Friend
qualified to speak with authority:</p>

<p>"The Friends have been consistent in all their peculiarities
with one central principle, the presence and inspiration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Divine Spirit in the human soul. This has been the reason for
their opposition to slavery. They felt, You cannot hold in
slavery <span class="smcap">GOD</span>! And God is in this black man's life, therefore
you cannot enslave God in him. So you must not inflict
capital punishment upon this man in whom is God.</p>

<p>"The same argument dignified woman, who was made the
equal of man. The same argument applies to the impossibility
of war. You cannot think of God fighting against
God. The Quaker had no sentimental idea of suffering; but
he believed that you cannot take life, in which is God.</p>

<p>"The same argument applied to weights and measures; the
Quakers early demanded that they be officially sealed. So
they believed in only one standard of truth, rather than one
for conversation and one for a court of justice. No oaths
were necessary for those who spoke for God all the time."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In this belief one sees the principle on which were selected
the reforms in which the Quaker Preacher was interested.
"He appears to have had ... his mind strongly influenced
to an active protest against the evils of slavery, war, capital
punishment and intemperance."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Each of these reforms was
inspired by reverence for human life, which was thought to
be desecrated or abused.</p>

<p>This simple code expressed itself in abstinence from practices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">believed to defile the body. Members of the Meeting</span><br />
early adopted a strict rule against the use of intoxicating
liquors. It is said of the ancestors of Richard Osborn that:
"Of these six generations not a man has ever been known
to use spirituous liquors, or tobacco, to indulge in profanity,
or to be guilty of a dishonest action."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A sense of personal degradation underlay their opposition
to poverty among members. There is record of an order of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Meeting, in 1775, for the purchase of a cow "to loan to
Joseph &mdash;&mdash;." The practice thus early observed has since
then been unbroken. The member of the community who
comes to want is at this day taken care of by popular subscription.
Through the early century the Meeting accomplished
this end, sometimes by formal, sometimes by informal
methods. In the later years of the nineteenth century it was
accomplished by special funds to which everybody gave. Thus
simply was poverty forestalled. The family assisted soon came
to self-support again. No debt was incurred, and no obligation
remained to be discharged; but every member of the
Meeting and of the community felt obliged to give and was
glad to give to this anti-poverty fund. The basis of it seems
to have been respect for human embodiments of the Divine
Spirit.</p>

<p>This ideal of personality, divinely indwelt, created a sense
of personal duty, even in opposition to all men. In the years
of anti-slavery agitation David Irish and his sister "made
their protest against slavery by abstaining as far as possible
from slave-made products; and together they made maple, to
take the place of cane sugar, and used nothing but linen and
woolen clothing (largely homespun)."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This later Quaker,
possessed of the spirit of the community of his fathers, shows
his inner conflict with the ideals of a competitive age in the
expression "so far as possible." It was not as practicable in
1855 to "abstain from slave-made products," as it would
have been in the year 1755.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the neighborhood expressed this simple
code. It was the custom to entertain the traveler in any house
to which he might come. It would have been wrong to exclude
him; he was welcomed with a dignified and formal
respect by these old Friends, because entertainment of guests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>in those days was a vital reality, as well as a religious practice.
These settlers in the wild forests believed that in every
wayfarer was a divine voice, a possible message from heaven.
They also treated every traveler as a possible object of their
"preachments," and spared not to "testify" to him of their
peculiar beliefs and "leadings." It was the Friends' method
of propagating their gospel to send men and women on
journeys, without pay, to distant states and provinces. This
religious touring was not peculiar to them, but it was made
by them an official agency of great power in evangelizing the
Colonies.</p>

<p>As an itinerant Friend, Woolman, the anti-slavery apostle,
came to the Hill in 176-. So Paul Osborn joined himself
to a party of Friends "travelling on truth's account," and
with them visited the Carolinas, in the years before the
Revolution. The same pioneer left in his will directions for
the entertainment of such travellers upon his estate forever.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>This religious itinerating was a part of the economic life
of those days as well; for the Friends never separated the
one from the other. Wherever they went they "testified,"
and to every place they came with shrewd appreciation of its
value as a place of settlement. Says James Wood: "Each
Quaker home as it was settled became a resting-place for those
who followed, for it was a cardinal principle of Quaker hospitality
to keep open house for all fellow-members, under all
circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p><p>The development of the hospitality that was a part of the
religion of the Quakers would be itself a sufficient study. It
has furnished some of the most interesting chapters of the
history of the Hill. It is now completely transformed, through
the pressure of competitive economic life; and, with undiminished<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">activities, has become a means of revenue in "the</span><br />
keeping of boarders." Seven of the old Quaker homes, in the
period of the Mixed Community, took on the aspect of small
hotels. For this business the Quakers have a preparation in
their history and traditions. They have an inbred genius
for hospitality. They have also a thrift and capacity for
"management" which have made their efforts successful. One
is impressed in their houses by a union of abundance with
economy, impossible to imitate.</p>

<p>Like other American pioneer neighborhoods, of a religious
type, the Quaker community at Oblong had a history in the
matter of sexual morality. The relations of the sexes offered to
the Friends a field in which their favorite doctrine of the indwelling
divine spirit produced moral harvests. The records
of Oblong Meeting are filled with cases of moral discipline.
There is scarcely a meeting in whose minutes some case is
not mentioned, either its initial, intermediate or final stages.
No family was exempt from this experience. The best families
furnished the culprits as often as they supplied the committees
to investigate and to condemn.</p>

<p>The regular method of procedure in marriage will best
exhibit the moral standards of the time. When a couple would
marry, they indicated to the Meeting their intention; and a
committee was at once appointed to investigate their "clearness."
That is, these two must be free of other engagements,
and must be free of debt or other incumbrance of such sort as
would render marriage impossible or unadvisable. At the
next monthly meeting the report of the committee advanced
the case one stage; and if they were found "clear of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
others," another committee was appointed "to see that the
marriage was orderly performed."</p>

<p>The parties on the day set appeared before the Meeting,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and in its regular course, stood up and said the words of
mutual agreement which made them man and wife. A certificate
was used, and to it the guests signed their names.
But no minister had official part in the ceremony. It was
their belief, to which they adhered with logical strictness, that
the divine spirit in each of the parties to a marriage made it
sacred, and that in marrying they spoke the will of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Entire continence was expected of every unmarried person,
and the strictest marital faithfulness of man and wife, because
of the sacredness of personal life. But in a pioneer society,
through those rough early decades, when for long times war
was disturbing the serenity of social life, the conduct of men
and women, not mindful of propriety, was determined by the
strong, masterful passions of an out of door people. Besides,
the government of the Meeting was contrary to the general
opinion of the countryside, and the Meeting House members
were immersed in a population whose standards were looser,
as well as sanctioned by authorities not recognized by the
Meeting. The result was that in the first century of the Hill,
1728-1828, there were many instances of sexual immorality,
many accusations of married persons untrue to their vows,
and a resulting attention of the whole community to this
theme which we do not know to-day. Frankness of discussion
of these matters prevailed. The punishments inflicted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>the public confessions demanded, the condemnation of specific
and detailed offences read from the steps of the Meeting
Houses, were all as far from present day approval as the
offences themselves from modern experience. The writer is
sure that, comparing the records of the Quaker Community
with his own knowledge of the annals of the Mixed Community,
there were more offences of this kind considered
by the Monthly Meeting of Oblong in any one year, 1728-1828,
than were publicly known in a population of the same
extent in the ten years 1890-1900. The commonest of these
offences were simple cases of illicit relations between unmarried
persons, or between persons, one of whom was married;
the offence often being associated in the minds of the
accusers with "going to frollicks." In these, as in all cases,
the Meeting received the complaint and appointed a committee
to investigate and to labor with the accused. On receiving its
report, if guilt was evidenced, the Meeting pressed the matter,
often increasing the size of the committee. It always
demanded an expression of repentance, and the restoration
of right conduct, without which no satisfaction was to
be had. If the accused persons, being found guilty, did not
repent, they were in the end "disowned." The disownment
by the Meeting was a serious penalty. It diminished a man's
business opportunities, it shut the door of social life to him,
and it effectually forbade his marriage within the Meeting.</p>

<p>Its power is shown in a number of cases recorded in the
minutes, in which the ban of the Meeting had been laid upon
some one, who was compelled later to come to the Meeting,
make a tardy acknowledgement, and be restored, before he
could proceed freely in some of the communal activities controlled
by the Meeting. Often the committee appointed by
the Meeting reported that they were not satisfied with the
repentance offered, seeing in it evidently more of policy than
penitence. Usually they received, in later visitations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
accused, sufficient tokens of submission, and the Meeting was
satisfied; but not always.</p>

<p>The most curious instance of the working out of this control
exercised by the Meeting, especially over the sexual relations,
is in the marriage of Joseph &mdash;&mdash; with Elizabeth &mdash;&mdash;.
The first act in the little drama was the formal written statement
of Joseph that he was sorry for "having been familiar
with his wife before his marriage to her." The Monthly
Meeting appointed a committee, as usual, after making record
of this "acknowledgment." After a month the committee reported
that they had visited Joseph, and found his repentance
sincere; and another committee was appointed to draw up a
testimony against his former misconduct, to which Joseph was
required to subscribe; and in a later month to hear it read
from the steps of the Preparative Meeting in the neighborhood
where he lived&mdash;or perhaps in that in which the offence was
best known. After this had all been done, with patient detail,
and reported and recorded, a further month elapsed, and then
announcement was made at the Meeting of the intention of
Joseph and Elizabeth to marry. The reader is astonished, thinking
that Joseph has already evidenced his loyalty to his wife.
A closer re-reading of the stages of the incident shows
that the wife mentioned in the original offence was now dead;
but that the offence was not dead. Joseph had to be restored
to the Meeting before he could marry Elizabeth, who was very
evidently a devoted member. To win his new wife, he had to
make acknowledgment of the offence which preceded his
former marriage.</p>

<p>This incident illustrates the whole attitude of that community
toward these moralities. They were thought to be
defilements of the body, the temple of God. No change of
outward condition could eliminate the offence, which must be
wiped out by repentance, public acknowledgment and formal
restoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident from the foregoing that the Meeting maintained
control over the community, at least of its own
members, by possessing an effective power to approve or to
disapprove of the economic and the marital condition of each
individual.</p>

<p>The code of morals practiced in this community required
strict business honesty. The Quaker has moral discretion in
economic affairs. He "expects to get what he pays for, and
he expects to give what he has agreed." The honesty of
"stroke-measure," by which bushels are topped off, the faithful
performance of contracts and payment of debts were inculcated
by the Meeting and enforced by its discipline.</p>

<p>This chapter may fitly close with a statement of the anathema
of Quakerism, pronounced many times in a year, during
the century. The offence selected shall be a moral one:</p>

<p>"Whereas, Jonathan Osgood hath had a right of membership
among us, the people called Quakers, but not taking
heed to the dictates of truth, hath so far deviated from the
good order established among Friends as to neglect attendance
of our religious meetings for worship and discipline, to
deviate from the plain scripture language, and to refuse to
settle with his creditors, and pay his just debts; and hath shut
himself up concealed from the civil authorities, therefore for
the clearing of truth and our Religious Society we do testify
against his misconduct, and disown him, the said Jonathan
Osgood, from being any longer a member of our Society, until
he shall from a true sight and sense of his misconduct condemn
the same to the satisfaction of the Meeting. Which
that he may is our desire for him. Signed, in and on behalf
of Purchase Monthly Meeting this th day of the th
month."</p>

<p>The above wording except the name is taken from the
minutes of Purchase Meeting; and some of the offences mentioned
in a few pages of those minutes, for which men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
disowned, or for acknowledgment pardoned and restored, are
the following: "deviating from plainness of speech and apparel"&mdash;"not
keeping to the plain scripture language;" "going
to Frollicks," "going to places of amusement," "attending a
horserace;" "frequenting a tavern, being frequently intoxicated
with strong liquor;" "placing his son out apprentice
with one not of our Society;" "leaving his habitation in a
manner disagreeable to his friends;" "to use profane language
and carry a pistol, in an unbecoming manner;" "bearing
arms;" "to challenge a person to fight;" "to marry with a
first cousin;" "to keep company with a young woman not of
our Society on account of marriage;" "to be married by a
magistrate;" "to marry with one not of our Society before a
hireling priest;" "to join principles and practice with another
society of people;" "to be guilty of fornication;" "to be unchaste
with her who is now my wife" (the person afterward
married by the accused). Oblong minutes: "to have bought
a negro slave," "to have bought a negro wench and to be
familiar with her."</p>

<p>It was the operation of this code of morals, and of its
ecclesiastical checks and curbs, that made the Quaker Hill
man and the Quaker Hill sentiment what they are. And having
done its work this code at the last tended to weaken the
Meeting, as it had strengthened the public conscience. In
talking recently with a sweet old lady past eighty, I asked her,
"Did you ever hear anyone disowned in meeting?" "No,"
she never had, and "doubted if there had been many." Later,
her daughter said, "Why, Grandmother, you married out of
meeting yourself!" Whereupon I asked again, "Well, what
did they do with you then?" "Oh," she replied, not at all
embarrassed, "they turned me out!"</p>

<p>"But what was the outcome of it all?" asks James Wood,
in the closing sentences of his monograph, "The Purchase
Meeting." He continues: "As a church the Quakers here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
missed their great opportunity. As settlers came among them
in increasing numbers, the Friends became solicitous to preserve
the strictest moral observance among their members.
They withdrew from contact and association with the world
about them and confined their religious influence and effort to
themselves. The strictest watch was maintained over the deportment
of old and young. Members were dismissed for
comparatively slight offences. Immigration further reduced
their numbers. Hypercriticism produced disagreements among
themselves. Finally, doctrinal differences arose which resulted
in a disastrous separation into two bodies in 1828."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE TOLERATION OF HOSTILE FORCES.</h3>


<p>Quaker Hill has been always a place of peace. The earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
settlers came to make an asylum for the propagation of the
principles of peace. I have spoken elsewhere of their consistent
belief and practice of this principle.</p>

<p>The community always acted promptly in response to
the known injury of its members. The Quakers have a
"Meeting of Sufferings," at which are related and recorded
the persecutions from which they suffer. This community,
which for one hundred years was Quaker, has always been
prompt to act "solidly and judiciously" in support of the injured.
An illustration is the riot in opposition to Surgeon
Fallon, who in January, 1779, was left here with convalescent
soldiers in the Meeting House. It is very interesting as
showing the length to which men will go in the interest of
peace, even to the use of violence. It illustrates also the fact
that kindness to the sick and wounded, simply because they
are helpless and needy, is modern, a humanitarian not a dogmatic
development.</p>

<p>To superior power the Quakers of this place have always
submitted. Their forefathers were loyalists in England, and
they in America, till far into the Revolution. But see the
resolutions passed in April, 1778:</p>

<p>"The answering of the 14th Query Respecting the Defrauding
of the King of his dues is omitted by reason of the
Difficulty of the times therefore this meeting desires the
Quarterly meeting to Consider whether it would not be well
to omit the answering that part of the Query in future until
the way may appear more Clear." This action was taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the meeting five months before the coming of Washington to
the Hill, immediately after the heroic winter of Valley Forge
and just before the British retreated from Philadelphia. An
official body which could speak of dues to the king at that
time, after their country had been separated from him for
three years, surely represented a community in which the great
majority were Loyalists, and the disorderly and violent were
Tories.</p>

<p>But the non-resistant character of the neighborhood, perched
between the Connecticut Yankees, who took ardent interest in
the Revolution, and the aggressive settlements of Pawling,
Fredericksburgh and Beekman, rendered the Hill at times an
asylum, strange to say, of the most adventurous forces. Whenever
in Colonial days an adventurer or soldier sought a peaceful
region in which to recruit his forces, he thought upon
Quaker Hill; and in four memorable instances used the Hill
as a place of safe refuge. There no one would by force resist
his enjoyment of a time for recruiting.</p>

<p>The first instance of this is the so-called "Anti-Rent War,"
which in 1766 excited the inhabitants of Dutchess and Columbia
Counties. Its sources were in the land grants made
by the Crown, and in the independent character of the settlers
in this state. The series of disturbances so caused continued
until well into the years of the nineteenth century. They
concern the local history only in one year, 1766.</p>

<p>The Anti-Rent War of 1766 is a forgotten event. But in
that time it aroused the Indians and the white settlers to
revolt. Bodies of armed men assembled, British troopers
marched from Poughkeepsie to Quaker Hill, to seize a leader
of rebellion; and at the time of his trial at Poughkeepsie in
August, 1766, a company of regulars with three field-pieces
was brought up from New York.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p><p>The prime cause of this insurrection was the granting of
the land in great areas at the beginning of the century to
favored proprietors, so that the actual settlers could not become
owners but only tenants. Fragments of such great
estates remain in the hands of certain families till our time.
The ownership of Hammersley Lake by the family of that
name is an example. The exercise of authority by these monopolists
of natural opportunities drove the actual tillers of the
soil, who had given it its value, to desperation. I have shown
that in 1740 no land owners were enrolled on Quaker Hill, and
that the list of its most representative citizens in 1755 contained
few landowners.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> A further cause of this conflict may
have been that, in the year of the settlement of the boundaries
of the Oblong it was granted to one company by the British
Crown, and to another by the Colony of New York. This
brought the title of all the lands on the Oblong into dispute.
Moreover, boundaries were carelessly indicated and loosely
described, a pile of stones or a conspicuous tree serving for a
landmark. All this worked great confusion, for the settlement
of which in a crude community courts were ineffective.</p>

<p>Finally the popular discontent broke out to the north in
armed refusal of settlers to pay the rents exacted. The movement
spread from Dutchess to Columbia County. William Prendergast,
who is said to have lived in a house standing on the
ground now part of the golf links in Pawling, was the leader
of the insurgents in this county. He assembled a band on
Quaker Hill so formidable that the grenadiers at Poughkeepsie
waited for reinforcements of two hundred troopers and two
field pieces from New York before proceeding against him.
The sight of the red coats was enough. Prendergast surrendered.
But so great was the local excitement that, to forestall
an attempt to rescue, he was taken a prisoner to New
York. In July he was brought back for trial; and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>same boat with the King's counsel, judges, lawyers and prisoner
came a company of soldiers to put down the continued
disturbance in Columbia County.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The trial occurred the first fortnight of August. Prendergast
was assisted in his defense by his wife, who made a
strong impression on the jury, proving that her husband, before
the acts of which he was accused, was "esteemed a sober,
honest and industrious farmer, much beloved by his neighbors,
but stirred up to act as he did by one Munro, who is absconded."
So ardent was this woman advocate that the State's
attorney forgot himself and moved that she be excluded from
the court room. The motion was denied, and the mover of it
emphatically rebuked. But there was not lacking proof of
the fact of treason, and Prendergast was convicted and sentenced
to be hanged in six weeks. Then this valiant woman's
energy and perseverance rose to their highest. She set off
for an audience with the Governor, Sir Henry Moore, Bart.,
and returned about the first of September with a reprieve.
Just in time she arrived, for a company of fifty mounted men
had ridden the whole length of the county to rescue her
husband from the jail. She convinced them of the folly of
such action as they proposed, and sent them home, while she
turned to the task of obtaining a pardon from the King.
Here, too, she was successful; for, six months later, George
III, who required six years to be subdued by a Washington,
released her husband. They arrived home amid great popular
rejoicings.</p>

<p>William Prendergast and Mehitabel Wing, whose descendants
settled later about Chautauqua Lake, New York, were
bound to the Quaker Community by ties of marriage and of
trade. William was not, so far as I can learn, a member of the
Meeting; but Mehitabel was a daughter of Jedidiah Wing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>whose family was devoted to the Society from 1744 until the
"laying down" of the Meeting in 1885. William Prendergast
was, however, a member of the community. His name heads
an account in the ledgers of the Merritt store, in 1771 and
1772, and his purchases indicate that he was a substantial
farmer whose trading center was Quaker Hill.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Prendergast
was an Irishman.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution he with his family and possessions,
a caravan of seventeen vehicles and thirty horses, emigrated
westward, going as far south as Kentucky, then north through
Ohio and New York. A part of the family company proceeded
to Canada. His son James settled, with other Prendergasts,
on Chautauqua Lake, and became the founder of Jamestown,
where his family, now extinct there, has given the city a
library. When William Prendergast and Mehitabel Wing, his
resolute wife, died, is not known. None of that name is
later found on or near Quaker Hill.</p>

<p>The motive of their hegira appears to have been chagrin
and a sense of humiliation at the sentence of death pronounced
upon the head of the family. In the Prendergast Library at
Jamestown is a book containing family histories, which came
from the Prendergast private library. From this book two
pages had been cleanly cut away. The Librarians set themselves
to replace the lost material, and after patient efforts in many
quarters, discovered another copy, and had typewritten pages
made and pasted in. Upon the missing pages, thus replaced
after the extinction of James Prendergast's family, was found
the account of William Prendergast's sentence to be hanged.
His descendants, had they lived longer, might have been more
proud than ashamed of his rebellion against injustice.</p>

<p>The Quakers, because they would passively tolerate an
intrusion, were forced to harbor another rendezvous of turbulent
men. It is said that Enoch Crosby, the famous spy
of the Revolution, who is believed to have been Cooper's
model for the hero of the novel, "The Spy," came to Quaker
Hill during the Revolution, in pursuance of a plan he was
at that time following, and got together a band of Tory volunteers,
who were planning to join the British army; and delivered
them to the Continental authorities, as prisoners. In
this he was assisted by Col. Moorehouse, who kept a tavern
on a site in South Dover, opposite the brick house which now
stands one-half mile south of the Methodist Church.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>I have spoken above of the sullen loyalty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Quakers to the British Crown during the Revolution. It
may have been in part owing to their loyalty that their neighborhood
became more congenial for the Tories who during
that period harried the country-side. The Quakers were
Tories, and are so called in the letters of the period; but
the word "Tories" remains in the speech of Quaker Hill as
a name of opprobrium. It describes a species of guerrillas
who infested parts of New York and Connecticut.</p>

<p>The "Tories" of the Revolutionary days furnish the substance
of the stories of violence that are told about the fireside
to Quaker Hill boys and girls. It is difficult, however,
to persuade those who have heard these tales to relate them.
Those who know them best are the very ones who cannot
recall them in systematic or orderly form. I mention only
one more of the free lances of the time. The chiefest of all
bandit-leaders of those turbulent times was Waite Vaughn.
It is related that this fellow was the head of a band of Tories,
which means locally the same that the term "Cowboys" or
"Skinners" means in the history of Westchester County. The
latter were lawless bands who infested the regions in which
the armies made civil life insecure, and subsisted by stealing
cattle, plundering houses, robbing and often murdering citizens.
"They seemed," says a writer, "like the savages to enjoy
the sight of the sufferings they inflicted. Oftentimes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
left their wretched victims from whom they had plundered
their all, hung up by their arms, and sometimes by their
thumbs, on barndoors, enduring the agony of wounds that had
been inflicted to wrest from them their property. These miserable
beings were frequently relieved by the American patrol."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Waite Vaughn lived in Connecticut in the part of New Fairfield
known as Vaughn's Neck. Under the house, recently
demolished, in which "Dr. Vaughn," his brother, is said to
have lived during the Revolution, was found rotted linen
below the cellar floor. Behind the great heap of the chimney
also was found a secret cellar, for years forgotten, in which,
among other rubbish of no significance, are said to have been
found counterfeit coins of the Revolutionary period and other
evidences of outlaw practices in that time.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Vaughn used to ride at night with his troop to Quaker
Hill, through Connecticut neighborhoods, which knew the
sound of his passing. The Pepper family still relate the tradition
of his riding up "Stony Hill," past the point where
stands Coburn Meeting House, in the night, while they and
their neighbors stayed discreetly indoors. This rendezvous
was a place in the woods on Irish land, about half way between
Sites 96 and 120, now known as "The Robber Rocks." Here
the Vaughns are said to have concealed booty at times, and
from this point they made forages upon farmhouses in the richest
neighborhoods of this vicinity. Probably they spared the
Quakers. I will speak later of the fact that Quakers have
ways of their own for protecting themselves against intruders.
Moreover, their men were not gone to the war.</p>

<p>The record of these years, on the pages of the clerk's
minute-book, are a disappointment. One searches in vain for
even the slightest trace of the presence in the Meeting House
of the troops. There is no record of the presence in the Meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ing
House of the "Tories" or guerrillas of the Revolution; and
not a word about the makers of the rifle-ports in the gables
of this building which the present writer discovered there,
unless it be the unruffled and serene utterance, under date of
8th Month, 9th, 1781, the very period at which the "Tories"
must have been at their worst: "Samuel Hoag is appointed to
take care of the Meeting House, and to keep the door locked
and windows fastened, and to nail up the hole that goes up
into the Garratt." The "Tories" robbed the store on Site 28.
They had hidden for that purpose in the loft of the Meeting
House and were discovered by some young Quakers who
were skylarking in the Meeting House under pretense of cleaning
it. The story is that one of the young men, being dared&mdash;of
course by a maiden&mdash;to open the trap-door into the garret,
and look for the Tories, found them hiding there. The bandits,
being discovered, tumbled down the hole from the garret, and
compelled their discoverers to go with them to the store; and
proceeded at once to plunder it, relying no doubt on the non-resistant
character of the people of the Hill. They stacked
their arms at the door and went about their business in a
thorough manner. But there was that in the blood of some
Quakers there that could not contain itself within the bounds
of non-resistance, and one of them, Benjamin Ferris, cried
out, "Seize the rascals." In the scrimmage that resulted from
the excitement of this remark, the leader of the Tories was
recognized by the young lady who had by her challenge to
the young man discovered them, and being taunted by her was
so incensed that he stabbed her. It is only said in closing the
story that the blood of both the fair and adventurous young
Quakeress whose abounding spirit brought on all the trouble,
and that of the leader of the "Tories," flows in the veins,
of some who live on the Hill in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Samuel Towner, a relative of Vaughn, resident in the
region of Fredericksburgh (now Patterson), returning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a trip, once found Vaughn at his home, and urged him at
once to leave, as his property would be confiscated, if Vaughn's
presence there were tolerated.</p>

<p>Vaughn was once pursued by farmers near Little Rest, and
was sighted and surrounded in a lonely road. He turned
upon his pursuers coolly and said: "Now, gentlemen, you can
arrest me, or kill me, but you must take the consequences;
for I will kill some of you." Daunted by his resolution, they
stood motionless while he crossed a fence and a field, and disappeared
among the trees of a wooded hill.</p>

<p>Quaker Hill became known as Vaughn's rendezvous, and
here he met his end, I think about 1781. His band had robbed
the home of one of the Pearce family, then as now resident
in the valley where Pawling village stands. The victim was
hung up by his thumbs till life was almost extinct. The next
day, Capt. Pearce, of the Revolutionary army, returned unexpectedly
to his home, and set off with armed assistance for
the Robber Rocks on Quaker Hill. Near that spot, in the
fields east of Site 97, on the Wing lands, Vaughn and his men
were resting, some picking huckleberries, and some playing
cards on a flat stone. Pearce gave no warning, but opened
fire at once. Vaughn fell mortally wounded. He was carried
to John Toffey's residence, Site 53, where he soon died.
He is buried under the trees outside the "Toffey Burying
Ground," beside the brook, in the very heart of Quaker Hill,
into which he had intruded because in that peaceful neighborhood
he had for a time a safe asylum. With his death it is
believed that his band dispersed, and their depredations ceased.</p>

<p>A peaceful people like the Quakers must find means of
their own to protect themselves against intruders. No one
can live long on Quaker Hill without knowing that they have
done so. One may brusquely intrude once, but he will be a
violent man indeed, not to say a dull one, who continues to
enjoy invading the preserves of the "Friends." The fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
instance of a forcible invasion of the Hill was that of Washington's
army, which encamped in the vicinity in the fall of
1778, the Headquarters being in John Kane's house, on a site
now within the borders of Pawling Village. See on Map I,
"HeadQrs."</p>

<p>On his arrival, September 19, 1778, Washington,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> with his
bodyguard, was entertained for six days at the home of Reed
Ferris, in the Oblong, Site 99,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> an honored guest, when
he moved to the place designated as his Headquarters
on his maps by Erskine. His letters written during his
residence here are all dated from "Fredericksburgh," the name
at that time of the western and older part of the town of
Patterson. Washington's general officers were quartered in
the homes of various residents of the neighborhood. One
was so entertained by Thomas Taber, at the extreme north
end of the Hill. It is natural to suppose that others were
housed in nearer places. That Lafayette was entertained at
the home of Russell, who lived at Site 25, now the Post-office,
is reliably asserted. The brick house standing at that time
was torn down by Richard Osborn, who erected the present
house. That Washington, with other officers, was entertained
at Reed Ferris's home is asserted by the descendants most
interested, and is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p>The Meeting House was appropriated by the army officers
for a hospital, because it was the largest available building.
The only official record, says Mr. L. S. Patrick, is that of
Washington's order, Oct. 20th, "No more sick to be sent to
the Hospital at Quaker Hill, without first inquiring of the
Chief Surgeon there whether they can be received, as it is
already full." Arguing from the date of Washington's order
above, Oct. 20, and from that of Surgeon Fallon below, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>use of the building for a hospital continued three and perhaps
five months. Meantime the Friends' Meetings were held in
the barn at Site 21, then the residence of Paul Osborn. This
barn had been the first Meeting House erected on the Hill
in 1742. It was removed to Site 21 in 1769, when it was used
as a barn till 1884, when it was removed by the present
resident.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>There is no mention, even by inference, in the records of
Oblong Meeting that proves this occupation of their building
by soldiers. It was not voluntarily surrendered; other
records show that the use of the building was supported by
force; its surrender was grudging, not a matter to be recorded
in the Meeting. It is characteristic of the Friends that they
ignored it.</p>

<p>This toleration of the Hospital was never sympathetic. A
letter of great interest to the student of those times was written
to the Governor of the State of New York, Hon. George
Clinton,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> by Dr. James Fallon, physician in charge of the sick
which were left on Quaker Hill, in the Meeting House, after
the departure of the Continental army. He could get no
one to draw wood for his hospital in the dead of winter, till
finally "old Mr. Russell, an excellent and open Whig, tho' a
Quaker," hired him a wagon and ox team. He could buy no
milk without paying in Continental money, six for one. He
declared that "Old Ferris, the Quaker, pulpiteer of this place,
old Russell and his son, old Mr. Chace and his family, and
Thomas Worth and his family, are the only Quakers on or
about this Hill, the public stands indebted to." The two
pioneers of the Hill, the preacher and the builder, were patriots
as well. He denounces the rest as Tories all, the "Meriths,"
Akins, Wings, Kellys, Samuel Walker, the schoolmaster, and
Samuel Downing, whom he declared a spurious Quaker and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>agent of the enemy; also the preacher, Lancaster, "the Widow
Irish;" and many he called "half-Quakers," who were probably
more zealous, and certainly more violent for Quaker and
Tory principles than the Quakers themselves.</p>

<p>The trouble culminated in Dr. Fallon's impressing the
wagons of Wing, Kelly and "the widow Irish," to take fourteen
men to Danbury and Fishkill to save their lives. The
former impress was not resisted; but the soldiers who took
the Irish team had to battle with a mob, headed by Abraham
Wing and Benjamin Akin, who used the convalescent soldiers
roughly, but could not prevent the seizure. They were not the
first men to do violence for the sake of the principle of non-resistance.
One can see, too, that modern Quakerism has
taken a gentler tone.</p>

<p>The small violence done by Abraham Wing and Benjamin
Akin, like that of young Ferriss to prevent the robbery of the
Merritt store, was ineffective. But the Quaker mode of self-protection
was more effective than violence. They "froze
out" the doctors and their soldiers from the Meeting House, by
leaving them alone in the bitter winter, by letting them starve.
The bitterness of their Toryism, and the zeal of Quaker ideals,
the ardor of their "make-believe," carried them too far. They
forgot mercy for the sake of opposing the cruelty of war.</p>

<p>Among the soldiers who lay sick in the Meeting House
many are said to have died. They were buried in the grounds
of the resident on Site 32, in the easterly portion of the field
facing the Meeting House. No stones mark their place of
rest, as none were ever placed in the cemetery of the early
Quakers in the western part of the same field. Over them
both the horses of persons attending meeting were tethered
for many decades. The ploughman and the mower for years
traversed the ground. But it is not forgotten who were buried
there.</p>

<p>Says L. S. Patrick in his attempt to estimate the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sickness and death of soldiers on the hill that winter:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> "Of the
conditions existing, the prejudices prevailing, and the probable
number in the Hospital, Dr. Fallon's letter to Governor Clinton
furnishes the only account known to exist: 'Out of the 100
sick, Providence took but three of my people off since my
arrival.' On the occasion of the arrival of Col. Palfrey, the
Paymaster General, at Boston from Fredericksburgh, General
Gates writes to General Sullivan: 'I am shocked at our poor
fellows being still encamped, and falling sick by the hundreds.'</p>

<p>"The death list&mdash;out of the oblivion of the past but four

1778; Peter King, 1st Pa., enlisted 1777, Quaker Hill Hospital,

<h3 class="chapter2">COMMUNICATION&mdash;THE ROADS.</h3>


<p>The roads were originally bridle paths, and to this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
many a stretch of road testifies in its steep grade to its use
in the days of the pack saddle. No driver of a wheeled vehicle
would have selected so abrupt a slope.</p>

<p>In the early days the roads had a north and south direction.
In the Period of Transition, with the diversion of commerce
to the railroad in Pawling, the roads of an east and
west direction became the principal roads, though the one
great Quaker Hill highway north and south is still the avenue
of communication on the Hill.</p>

<p>As the years passed wagons were used; indeed, by the time
of the Revolution, in the second generation, they were bearing
all the transportation. The state of the roads is shown, however,
by the fact that Daniel Merritt was accustomed to pay,
in 1772, £1, or $5, for carting four barrels of beef to the river;
that is, about 1,000 lbs. constituted a load. At the present
state of the country roads, a Quaker Hill employer would expect
2,000 lbs. to make a load. The state of the roads before
the turnpikes were made, that is, before 1800 to 1825, is described
by a resident as follows: "The road was so full of
stones, large and small, that people of to-day would consider
impassable for an empty wagon, to say nothing of drawing
a load over it. In the fall of the year it is said that toward
evening one could hear the hammering of the wheels of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wagons on the stones of the road a distance of four or five
miles."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I cannot learn that Quaker Hill was during the Quaker
Period on any main line of country travel. Marquis De Chastelleux
records in his "Travels in North America," that he
journeyed in 1789 to Moorehouse's Tavern (see Map I) along
the Ten Mile River, two or three miles from the Housatonic
to "several handsome houses forming part of the district
known as <i>The Oblong</i>. The inn I was going to is in the
Oblong, but two miles farther on. It is kept by Col. Moorehouse,
for nothing is more common in America than to see
an inn kept by a colonel ... the most esteemed and most
creditable citizen." There was no inn on Quaker Hill and no
colonel. The Quaker aversion to military titles was then as
great as to the sale of rum. The houses referred to by the
French traveller were probably the northern boundary of the
Quaker community, at what is now Webatuck. I cannot find
record of any post road coming nearer than this, until in the
19th century a stage was maintained between Poughkeepsie
and New Milford, by way of Quaker Hill, making the journey
every other day, and stopping at John Toffey's store at Site 53.</p>

<p>The building of turnpikes became, in the years following
1800, a popular form of public spirit. Says Miss Taber: "In
fact, turnpikes seemed to be a fad in those days all over the
state and probably a necessary one. The longest one I learn
of in this part of the country was from Cold Spring on the
Hudson River to New Milford in Connecticut. The turnpike
in which the people of this neighborhood were most interested
was the one incorporated April 3, 1818, and reads, 'That Albro
Akin, John Merritt, Gideon Slocum, Job Crawford, Charles
Hurd, William Taber, Joseph Arnold, Egbert Carey, Gabriel
L. Vanderburgh, Newel Dodge, Jnrs., and such other persons
as shall associate for the purpose of making a good and suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>cient
turnpike road in Dutchess Co.' It was named as the
Pawlings and Beekman Turnpike, being a portion of what
is known as the Poughkeepsie road passing over the West
Mountain, but we do not find that anything was done until
after the act was revived in 1824, when Joseph C. Seeley,
Benoni Pearce, Samuel Allen, Benjamin Barr and George W.
Slocum were associated with them."</p>

<p>The Pawlings and Beekman Turnpike maintained a tollgate
till 1905, when it was burned down; and the company,
which had long discussed its discontinuance, then abandoned
its private rights in that excellent stretch of road. The
turnpike which crossed Quaker Hill ended at the Jephtha
Sabin residence, known to the present generation as "the
Garry Ferris place," Site 74. The roads of the neighborhood
were the same in 1778-80 as at the present day, as will be seen
from a comparison of Map 1, made by Erskine for Washington,
and Map 2, which is a copy of the U. S. Survey; except
the road from Mizzen-Top Hotel to Hammersley Lake,
made after the hotel was erected. The comparison of maps
shows also, to one who knows the use of these roads, that they
have changed from a north and south use to an east and west
use; the highway on the northward slope of the Hill in
Dover, and on the southward slope in Patterson, being but
little used to-day. The road from the Meeting House and
cemetery westward, which was once much favored, is now
scarcely ever used, and being neglected by the authorities, is
little more than a stony gutter.</p>

<p>The whole character of the neighborhood was changed by
a revolution in transportation. Not turnpikes effected the
change, but railroads. The early years of the nineteenth century
were filled with expectation of new modes of travel.
Robert Fulton was building his steamboat amid the derision
of his contemporaries, and to their amazement steaming
up the Hudson against the tide. At first canals seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
country folk the solution of their problem. They occupied in the
dawn of the 19th century the place which trolley cars occupy
in the minds of promoters to-day. A canal was planned to
run through the Harlem valley, where now Pawling stands,
and Quaker Hill men were among the promoters of it, among
them Daniel Akin and Johnathan Akin Taber.</p>

<p>Presently, however, came the promotion of railroads, and
many of the same men who had favored the canals, entered
heartily into the new projects. The foundation of Albert
Akin's fortune was made when, about 1830, he began to
borrow money of his neighbors and invest in the rapidly growing
lines of steam-cars in New York State. There were those,
however, who foresaw dire things from the new iron highway,
and old residents tell of "one man who said that whosoever
farm that locomotive passed through would have to give up
fatting cattle, as it would be impossible to keep a steer on the
place."</p>

<p>For many years the railroad came no nearer than Croton
Falls. Richard Osborn used to tell the story of one resident
of the Hill who boasted that he could go to New York
and return the same day. This he finally attempted and accomplished
by driving with a good pair of horses to Croton
Falls in the morning, taking an early train to New York, returning
in the evening, and driving home before night. This
story, which is well authenticated, proves the good condition
of some of the roads before 1849, for the drive to
Croton Falls is about twenty miles. Among leading Quaker
Hill residents who promoted railroads in the valley
were Jonathan Akin, Daniel D. Akin, J. Akin Taber, John and
Albert J. Akin. The two men who were most influential in
completing the last link of the road&mdash;from the local viewpoint&mdash;were
Albert Akin and Hon. John Ketcham, of Dover,
both recently deceased. They supplied cash for the continuation
of the road from Croton Falls to Dover Plains. To Mr.
Akin the promise was made that if he would supply a building
for a station the road would place an eating house at the
point nearest Quaker Hill. There was then no such village
or hamlet as Pawling, the locality being known as "Goosetown."
Patterson was an old village, west of its present business
center one mile, and was known as Fredericksburgh.
Dover also was a place of distinction in the country-side. Mr.
Akin, with several yoke of oxen, hauled a dwelling to the
railroad track from the site on which Washington's Headquarters
stood in 1778; and thus was initiated the settlement
of the village which is now among the most thriving on the
road.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">A QUAKER GENTLEMAN</span>
</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>At that time Quaker Hill was the most prosperous community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for many miles around. A description of its industries
will be found elsewhere, in Chap. IV, Part I. The coming of the
railroad changed the whole aspect of things. The demand for
milk to be delivered by farmers at the railroad station every
day, and sold the next day in New York, began at once. It
soon became the most profitable occupation for the farmers
and the most profitable freight for the railroad. Eleven years
after the first train entered Pawling came the war, with inflated
prices. The farmer found that no use of his land paid
him so much cash as the "making of milk," and thereafter the
raising of flax ceased, grain was cultivated less and less,
except as it was to be used in the feeding of cattle, and even
the fatting of cattle soon had to yield to the lowered prices
occasioned by the importation of beef from western grazing
lands. The making of butter and cheese, with the increased
cost of labor on the farms, was abandoned, that the milk
might be sold in bulk to the city middleman. The time had not
come, however, in which farmers or their laborers imported
condensed milk, or used none. Quaker Hill farmers lived too
generously and substantially for that; but they ceased, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Civil War, when milk was bought "at the platform" for
six cents a quart, to make butter or cheese.</p>

<p>Thus the Harlem Railroad transformed Quaker Hill from
a community of diversified farming, producing, manufacturing,
selling, consuming, sufficient unto itself, into a locality
of specialized farming. Its market had been Poughkeepsie,
twenty-eight miles away, over high hills and indifferent roads.
Its metropolis became New York City, sixty-two miles away
by rail and four to eight miles by wagon road.</p>

<p>With the railroad's coming the isolated homogeneous community
scattered. The sons of the Quakers emigrated. Laborers
from Ireland and other European lands, even negroes from
Virginia, took their places. New Yorkers became residents
on the Hill, which became the farthest terminus of suburban
traffic. The railroad granted commuters' rates to Pawling,
and twice as many trains as to any station further out. The
population of the Hill became diversified, while industries
became simplified. In the first century the people were one,
the industries many. In the Period of the Mixed Community, in
the second century, the people were many and the industries
but one. I speak elsewhere of these elements of the mixed
community. Suffice it to have traced here the simplifying of
the economic life of the Hill, by the influence of the railroad,
which made the neighborhood only one factor in a vaster
industrial community, of which New York was the center.
When the Meeting House and the Merritt store were for a
century the centers of a homogeneous Quaker community, it
was a solid unit, of one type, doing varied things; when Wall
Street and Broadway became the social and industrial centers,
a varied people, no less unified, did but one thing.</p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IIB" id="CHAPTER_IIB"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">ECONOMIC CHANGES.</h3>


<p>The transition from the mixed or diversified farming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the Quaker community to the special and particular farming
of the mixed community is written in the growth of the dairy
industry, which in the year 1900 was the one industry of the
Hill. In 1800 dairy products were only beginning to emerge
from a place in the list of products of the Quaker Hill lands
to a single and special place as the only product of salable
value. While the Hill people constituted a community dependent
on itself and sufficient unto itself, the exceptional
fitness of the "heavy clay soil" to the production of milk,
butter and cheese did not assert itself, and wheat, rye, flax,
apples, potatoes were raised in large quantities and sold; but
in the period of opening communication with the world
in general, exactly in proportion as the Hill shared in the
growth of commerce, by so much did the dairy activities supplant
all other occupations. The order of this emergence is
a significant commentary upon the opening of roads and the
development of transportation. The stages are: first, cheese
and butter; second, fat cattle; and third, milk. At the end of
the Quaker community, when the best roads were of the east
and west directions, and Poughkeepsie was the market-place,
cheese and butter were made for a "money crop," by the
women, who retained the money for their own use.</p>

<p>There is a story told in the Taber and Shove families,
which prettily shows the customs in the Quaker century.
Anne Taber, wife of Thomas Taber, substantial pioneer at
the north end of the Hill, "had a fine reputation as a cheese
maker." Being a New England woman, she was of the few
who in Revolutionary days were in sympathy with the Col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>onies,
and she gave forth that she would present a cheese to
the first general officer who should visit the neighborhood.
"One day, being summoned to the door," writes one of her
descendants, "she was greatly surprised to find a servant of
General Washington, with a note from him claiming, under
conditions of the promise, the cheese. Of course it was sent,
and the General had opportunity to test her skill in that domestic
art."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The Taber family did not preserve that note; but in the
Treasury Department of the United States, among Washington's
memoranda of expenditures, is the item under date of
Nov. 6, 1778, "To Cash paid servant for bringing cheese from
Mr. Taber, 16 shillings." It would seem that the fame of
Anne Taber's cheeses had won her a market with the officers
at Headquarters, for sixteen shillings was payment "for bringing
cheese" in large quantity, and the date is six weeks after
the arrival of Washington for his stay in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In the ledger of the Merritt store, under date of Nov. 6,
1772, Thomas Taber, Esq., is credited as follows: "By 29
cheses wd. 484 lb. at 6d., £12 2s." In that year Thomas Taber,
Esq., satisfied his account with an ox, £6 16s.; cash, £10; three
pounds and nine ounces of old pewter, 4s. 6d.; seven hogs,
£20 11s. 6d., and the above 29 cheeses. So that approximately
one-fourth of the "money crop" of this substantial farmer was
in the form of a dairy product. In the year 1895, the average
Quaker Hill farm was producing, as will be shown in Chapter
III, Part III, ninety per cent. of dairy product, namely milk.</p>

<p>The second phase of the industry proper to Quaker Hill
was that of raising fat cattle. This culminated at the end of the
period of the Quaker Community. In this industry were laid
the foundations of some large fortunes. It brought in its day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>more money into the neighborhood than any other occupation
had ever brought. It disappeared with the coming of the railroad
into the valley, bringing, in refrigerator cars, meat from
western lands, and killed in Chicago. Then the cattle were
fattened on these hills, in the rich grass, and driven to New
York to be killed and sold there.</p>

<p>In "Some Glimpses of the Past," Miss Taber says: "But
the chief business of most farmers was the fatting of cattle.
The cattle were generally bought when from two to three
years old, usually in the fall, kept through the winter and the
following summer fattened and sold. They were the only
things that did not have to go to the river to reach the market.
From all over the country they were driven to New York
on foot, and the road through the valley was the main thoroughfare
for them. Monday was the market day in New
York and all started in time to reach the city by Saturday.
From Pawling the cattle were started on Thursday, and those
from greater distances planned to reach this part of their
journey on that day. It used to be said that the dealers could
tell what the market would be in New York on the following
Monday by watching the cattle that passed through Pawling
on Thursday. The cattle were collected and taken to the city
by drovers; theirs was a great business in those days. Hotels
or taverns were provided for their accommodation at frequent
intervals along the road. Ira Griffin was a drover and Mr.
Archibald Dodge remembers when a boy going to New York
with him and his cattle, walking all the way. There were also
droves of cattle other than fat ones, on the road, some called
store cattle, and the books of Mr. Benjamin V. Haviland, who
kept one of the taverns, show that in the year 1847 there had
been kept on his place 27,784 cattle, 30,000 sheep and 700
mules, and it is said that occasionally there would be 2,000
head between his tavern and that of John Preston's in Dover.
When Mr. Albert J. Akin was a young man he was consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ered
an expert judge and buyer of steers for fattening, and
generally had the finest herd of fat cattle."</p>

<p>This reference is to the business at its height and applies
to the years 1800-1850. In the books of John Toffey's store
are frequent references to the business.</p>

<p>Interesting material is furnished for the study of the period
of transition, in the records of the store kept by John Toffey
at Site No. 53. These old day-books and ledgers are incomplete,
but they cover spaces of time in the years 1814, 1824,
1833; and their account of the purchases made by John
Toffey's customers furnishes a record, we may suppose, of the
goods brought into the households on the Hill at that time,
from other communities; as well as the actual exchange of
commodities on the Hill, where at that time diversified industries
were carried on.</p>

<p>The growth of trade in these respects, from the period
1814-1816 to the period 1824-1833 will be considered in four
lines, as it is exhibited in the commodities: first of Costume,
second of Food and Medicine, and third of Tools and
Material for Industry, fourth, of House-furnishings. It is
assumed that John Toffey kept a representative store, and
that the growth in his trade corresponded to the growth in
the commercial interchange in the community.</p>

<p>In 1814-1816 the imported goods kept and sold by John
Toffey are cloth (perhaps in part locally manufactured), indigo,
thread, cambric, penknives, knitting needles, spelled
"nittenneedels," plaster, fine salt, molasses, tea, apple-trees,
nutmeg, shad and occasionally other fish. The list is brief,
and its proportion to the other commodities sold in the store
evidences the simplicity of a community dependent chiefly upon
itself, and living a life of rudeness and content.</p>

<p>Among prices which change in the twenty years recorded in
John Toffey's books are those of molasses which was in 1814-1816
$2.00 per gallon, and fell to $1.25 and in 1824 to 35c. per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
gallon. "Tobago" was sold in 1814 at $2.75 per pound, and
later for 62c. Flour was sold in 1814 for $18 per barrel, or 9c.
per pound; wool hats at $4; fine salt 10c. per pound; plaster
$3.25 per hundredweight; boots at $9.00; tea at $2.75 per
pound.</p>

<p>A day's work for a man in 1814-1816 was from $1.00 per
day for ordinary work, to $1.25 for driving oxen, or $1.50
for "digging a grave," or the same amount "for going after
the thief."</p>

<p>House-rent is recorded at the rate of thirty dollars a year.</p>

<p>One may explain the high rates of many of these commodities,
and the relatively high rate paid for labor by the
prevalence of war prices at the time. Commodities such as
molasses would be expensive as a result of the stoppage of
sea-trade; and the labor market was exhausted to supply the
army with soldiers.</p>

<p>In 1824 Toffey imported, for Costuming, shawls, crepe at
$1 per yard, silk, skein-silk, twist, ribbon, velvet at 90c. per
yard, drab-cloth, flannel, braid, handkerchiefs, buttons and
button-moulds, gloves, suspenders, calico, vest patterns, pins,
chrome-yellow, "bearskin" at 82c. per yard, dress handkerchiefs,
beads, buckles, silk flags and morocco skins.</p>

<p>Of new foods he imported molasses at 35c. per gallon,
oranges at 2c. each, which he seems to have sold only one by
one, sugar at 6c., tobacco at 12c., alum, tea at 85c., salt at $1
per bushel, pepper, all-spice, raisins, salt-peter, pearlash, castile
soap, hard soap, paregoric, ginger, logwood, vitriol, cinnamon,
snuff, sulphur, cloves, mustard, opium, coffee, loaf
sugar, watermelons, and seeds for beets, lettuce, parsnips.</p>

<p>Of House-furnishings, he had for sale, knives, forks&mdash;one
set of knives and forks selling for $13, plates, bowls, pitchers,
mugs, teacups, teapots, decanters, almanacs, brooms, oilcloth,
glass and putty, inkstands, bedsteads, spoons in sets, sugar-bowls,
tin pans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Tools and Materials for Industry he sold nails by the
"paper," by the hundred and by the pound, files, oil at 75c. a
gallon, locks, slates, paper, pocket-books, pencils, turpentine,
raw steel and iron, spectacles at 34c., sandpaper, shovels and
spades, screws, gimlets.</p>

<p>Rum, brandy and gin appear also, with powder, shot and
fishhooks, as tributes to the convivial and adventurous spirit.
But the convivial spirits were the better patrons, for there
was scarcely an entry in certain years in which was not an
item of alcoholic spirits. The sporting goods were only occasionally
purchased.</p>

<p>In 1833 for Costuming, cotton-batting had appeared, and
canton flannel, canvas, blue jeans at 83c. per yard, brown
Holland, cloth at $3.64 per yard, hats at 44c. each, hooks and
eyes, pearl buttons at 10c. a dozen, side combs, bandanna
handkerchiefs; while sole-leather was still sold in quantity,
with buckskin mittens, which were scarcely made on the Hill.</p>

<p>For Industry, behold the arrival of pincers, gum arabic,
"Pittsburgh cord" at 21c. per yard. In Housings, candles,
frying pans, tin pails, dippers, tin basins, wash-tubs made their
appearance; and in this year for the first time window-blinds
were sold, for 75c.</p>

<p>For Food and Medicines John Toffey offered at this time
codfish, coffee, souchong tea, crackers, castor oil, camphor
gum, Epsom salts.</p>

<p>Meantime, a day's wages had fallen from $1 and $1.50 to
65c. and 75c. per day.</p>

<p>The growth of trade in John Toffey's store is summarized
in Table I. In this table may be seen also the growth of economic
demand. The increase of the number of kinds of commodities
in each evidences the acquirement of varied tastes by
this people of the Hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The above summary of the importations to the Hill in the
years 1814-1833 casts light upon the social and religious history
of the period in question; in which occurred the greatest
social convulsion this community has ever known. In the
year 1828 the Religious Society of the Friends was divided,
never to be united, the integrity of the community as a social
and religious unit was ended, the ties of a century were
severed, and instead of the "unity" of which Quakers are
always so conscious, came mutual criticism, recrimination,
and excommunication of one-half of the community by the
majority of the Meeting. Thus ended the communal life of
Quaker Hill, and began the disintegration of the community
which is now almost complete.</p>

<p>It is true that this schism was general throughout the denomination,
in all the United States; and that it was shared
in its doctrinal influences by the Congregational churches, the
Unitarian Association having been formed in Boston in 1825.
But nevertheless it had roots on Quaker Hill in an economic
condition; and that economic condition may have been general
throughout the Eastern States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Let the doctrinal causes of this schism be considered elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Economic causes are hinted at in the above paragraphs.
There came in many embellishments of life which
must have seemed to early Friends mere luxuries, and to the
stricter few must have appeared instruments of sin, as "beads,"
"ribbons," velvet, silk, braid, crepe, shawls, dress handkerchiefs,
buckles, silk flags, pearl buttons&mdash;these are expressions
of new states of mind. The economic change underlying the
social convulsion is seen in the increase of varied stuffs for
costume, articles and materials for the food and medicine
cupboards of the farmhouses, and in more varied tools and
materials both for industry and house furnishing.</p>

<p>Even more influential than the exciting power of luxuries
would be the quieter and more pervasive stimulus of comfort.
Houses that are glazed and ceiled and furnished with well
adapted implements in every room; tables set with all the wares
of leisurely and pleasurable feeding speak a new state of
affairs. The people so clothed and so fed begin to produce in
every family some members of cultured tastes, some of
independent thought, who are restive under the denials of
Quakerism.</p>

<p>Business and industry too become more varied; and the
effect of this prosperous and varied industry shows itself in
active and critical minds. Importation from places beyond
Poughkeepsie awakened imagination and invited reflection
upon the state of the world.</p>

<p>All this time the daily wage continued to fall, from $1 and
$1.50 in 1814 to 50c., 65c. and 75c. in 1833. It is said that
men bitterly commented, in those days of the rapid development
of the country, that a farmer who paid a laborer fifty
cents for a day's labor in the hay-field from daybreak to dark,
would pay the same amount, fifty cents, for his supper on the
Hudson River boat, when he made his annual visit to the
great city of New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p><p>We have, then, in John Toffey's daybook a reflection of
conditions which had to do with the break-up of the community,
as truly as did the theological difference between
Elias Hicks and the Orthodox. Comfortable living, diversified
and intensified industry, importation of expensive and
stimulating comforts, leisure with its sources in wealth, and
its tendencies toward reflection, and especially a differentiation
of the homogeneous community into diverse classes, owing to
lowered wages and multiplied embellishments of life, made up
altogether the raw materials of discontent, criticism and
division.</p>

<p>These factors go with a state of growing discontent and
disintegration. The men and women possessed of leisure cultivated
a humanist state of mind, with which arose a critical
spirit, a nicer taste and a cultured discrimination. They were
offended by literalism, bored by crudeness however much in
earnest, and disgusted with the illogical assertions of pietists.
The imperative mandate of the meeting awakened in them
only opposition. They found many to sympathize with their
state of mind.</p>

<p>On the other side there were those who seriously feared
the incoming of luxurious ways. They distrusted books, remembering
the values of one Book to the laborer who reads
it alone; they believed in plainness, and their minds associated
freedom of dress with freedom of thought. They resented
also the new privileges conferred on some by wealth, because
to most had come only harder work with discontent.</p>

<p>The schism which rent the community was an economic
heresy, the belief in the use of money for embellishment of
life. All the Quakers regarded with favor the making of
money. The Liberals, however, saw ends beyond money, and
processes of ultimate value beyond administration and business.
They looked for household comforts, books, travel, and
the leisure with great souls who have written and have ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>pressed
the greatest truths. They believed in a divinity such
as could have made, and regarded with favor, the whole
teeming world.</p>

<p>The Orthodox saw the values of prosperity only in plainness
of life, recognized no divinity in humanized manners, and
sternly but ineffectually called the community back to idealized
commonplaceness, and to hear the utterances of rude
ploughmen and cobblers in the name of Deity.</p>

<p>One ventures to believe, too, that there was a falling away
from all religious exercises at this time, and that the pious
of both schools were troubled about it, and accused one another.
The poor were too hard worked and too poorly paid
to feel anything but discontent; and the leaders of the community
differed as to the solution of the religious problem.
Hence came division.</p>

<p>The Quakers are conscious of religious "unity," but their
mode of life is a true economic unity. The Quaker Community
was re-arranging itself economically, but the members
felt a religious change. Class division was coming upon them,
and they felt it as a sectarian division. It was indeed the end
of the old community ruled by religion, and the formation of
a new neighborhood life; a new Quakerism, ruled by economic
classes: the persons of influence being invariably persons of
means, and the dominating leaders rich. Doubtless the
Quakers who led in the Division of 1828 hoped, in each party
equally, to maintain the old religious domination. The community
has never granted that leadership to the divided Meeting,
neither to the Orthodox, nor to the Hicksites. The real
power has, since a period antedating the division, been in the
hands of those who have owned farms centrally located; who
in addition to owning land centrally located have been possessed
of large means: the "rich men" and "wealthy women" have
possessed a monopoly of actual leadership. If also, they have
been religiously inclined, their leadership has been absolute.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">RELIGIOUS LIFE IN TRANSITION.</h3>


<p>In religion the solidarity of this country place has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
best shown in the fact that, during most of its history, it has
had but one church at a time. For one hundred years there
was the undivided meeting. From 1828 to 1885 the Hicksite&mdash;Unitarian,
branch of the Friends held the Old Meeting House,
with diminishing numbers. The Orthodox had their smaller
meeting house around the corner, attended by decreasing gatherings.
In 1880 was organized Akin Hall, in which till 1892
were held religious services in the summer only. Since that
time religious services have been held there all the year round.
The early united meeting had a membership of probably two
hundred, and audiences of three hundred were not uncommon.</p>

<p>The church in Akin Hall, named "Christ's Church,
Quaker Hill," had in 1898 a membership of sixty-five, and
audiences of fifty to two hundred and fifty, according to the
occasion and the time of year. In the past the general attitude
of the community toward religion has been reverent and sympathetic.
It is no less so to-day.</p>

<p>Of religious ceremonies the Quakers claim to have none.
But they are fond of ceremoniousness beyond most men. The
very processes by which they abolish forms are made formal
processes. They have ceremonies the intent of which is to
free them from ceremony. The meeting is called to order by
acts ever so simple, and dismissed by two old persons shaking
hands; but these are invariable and formal as a doxology and
a benediction. They receive a stranger in their own way. A
visiting minister is honored with fixed propriety. An expelled
member is read out of meeting with stated excommunicatory
maledictions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Worship has had on Quaker Hill a large place in characterizing
the social complexion of the people. By this, I mean
that the peculiarities of the Quaker worship, now a thing of
the past, have engraved themselves upon character. Those
peculiarities are four: the custom of silence; the non-employment
of music, or conspicuous color or form; the separate
place provided for women; the assertion and practice of
individualism.</p>

<p>The silence of the Quaker meeting is far from negative.
It is not a mere absence of words. It is a discipline enforced
upon the lower elements of human nature, and a reserve upon
the intellectual elements, in order that God may speak. I
think that in this silence of the meeting we discover the working
of the force that has moulded individual character on
Quaker Hill and organized the social life. For this silence is
a vivid experience, "a silence that may be felt." The presence
and influence of men are upon one, even if that of God be not.
The motionless figures about one subtly penetrate one's consciousness,
though not through the senses. They testify to
their belief in God when they do not speak better than they
could with rhetoric or eloquence. It is the influence of many,
not of one; yet of certain leaders who are the organs of this
impression, and of the human entity made of many who in
communion become one. The self-control of it breathes power,
and principle, and courage. One would expect a Quaker meeting
to exert an imperious rule upon the community. It is an
expression of the majesty of an ideal. I believe that the
Quaker Hill meeting has been able to accomplish whatever
it has put its hand to do. The only pity is that the meeting
tried to do so little.</p>

<p>The original religious influence of Quakerism, carried
through all changes and transformation, was a pure and relentless
individualism. It was the doctrine that the Spirit of God
is in every heart of man, absolutely every one; resisted indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by some, but given to each and all. With honest consistency
it must be said, the Quakers applied this&mdash;and this it was they
did apply&mdash;to the status of women, to the question of slavery,
to the civic relations of men. This it was that made Fox and
Penn refuse to doff their hats before judge, or titled lord, or
the king himself.</p>

<p>The character of the common mind of the community has
been much influenced by the fact that the Quakers made no
use of color, form and music either in worship or in private
life; that they also idealized the absence of these. They
made it a matter of noble devotion. In nothing do local traditions
abound more than in stories of the stern repression of
the aesthetic instincts. One ancient Quakeress, coming to the
well-set table at a wedding, in the old days, beheld there a
bunch of flowers of gay colors, and would not sit down until
they were removed. Nor could the feast go on until the
change was effected. So great was the power of authority,
working in the grooves of "making believe," that those who
might have tolerated the bouquet in silence, as well as those
who had sensations of pleasure in it, supported her opposition.</p>

<p>I have spoken elsewhere of the effect of this century-long
repression and ignoring of the aesthetic movements of the
human spirit, in banking the fires of literary culture in this
population. The present generation, all inheriting the examples
of ancestors ruled in such unflinching rigor, has in
none of its social grouping any true sense of color or of the
beauty of color. Neither in the garments of those who have
laid off the Quaker garb, nor in the decorations of the houses
is there a lively sense of the beauty of color. None of the
women of Quaker extraction has a sense of color in dress;
nor can any of them match or harmonize colors. I except,
of course, those whose clothing is directly under the control
of the city tailor or milliner. The general effect of costume
and of the decorations of a room, in the population who get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
their living on the Hill, is that of gray tones, and drab effects;
not mere severity is the effect, but poverty and want of color.</p>

<p>In forms of beauty they know and feel little more. I do
not refer to the lack of appreciation of the elevations and slopes
of this Hill itself&mdash;a constant delight to the artistic eye. Farmers
and laborers might fail to appreciate a scene known to
them since childhood. But there is in the Quaker breeding,
which gives on certain sides of character so true and fine a
culture a conspicuous lack in this one particular.</p>

<p>As to music, even that of simplest melody, it has come to
the Hill, but it "knows not Joseph." An elderly son of Quakerism
said: "You will find no Quaker or son of the Quakers
who can sing; if you do find one who can sing a little, it will
be a limited talent, and you will unfailingly discover that he
is partly descended from the world's people."</p>

<p>The effect of this aesthetic negation appears, it seems to the
present writer, in a certain rudeness or more precisely a certain
lack in the domain of manners, outside of the interests in
which Quakerism has given so fine a culture. This appears to
be keenly felt by the descendants of Friends. Not in business
matters; for they are made directors of savings banks and
corporations, and trustees, and referees, and executors of estates,
in all which places they find themselves at home. Nor
is it a lack of dignity and composure in the parlor or at the
table. Nor is it a lack of sense of propriety in meetings of
worship. But it is in matters ethical, civic and deliberate, and
in the free and discursive meetings of men, in which new
and intricate questions are to arise; in positions of trust, in
which the highest considerations of social responsibility constitute
the trust; in these, the men and women trained in Quakerism
are lacking throughout whole areas of the mind, and
lacking, too, in ethical standards, which can only appeal to
those whose experience has fed on a rich diversity of sources
and distinctions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>In this I speak only of the Quaker group and of those who
have been under its full influence. It does not apply to the
Irish Catholics, nor to the incomers from the city. The Quakers
and their children lack precisely those elements of aesthetic
breeding which would be legitimately derived from contemplation
and enjoyment of beauty aside from ethical values. Ethical
beauty, divorced from pure beauty, a stern, bare, grim beauty
they have, and their children and employees have. But they
have little sense of order in matters that do not proceed to the
ends of money-making, housekeeping and worship. They
do not seem to possess instinctive fertility of moral resource.
It may be due to other sources as well, but it seems to the
present writer that the moral density shown by some of these
birthright Quakers, upon matters outside of their wonted and
trodden ethical territories, is due to their long refusal to recognize
aesthetic values, and to see discriminations in the field in
which ethics and aesthetics are interwoven.</p>

<p>They made red and purple to be morally wrong, idealizing
the plainness of their uncultured ancestry, and sweet sounds
they excluded from their ears, declaring them to be evil noises,
because they would set up the boorishness of simple folk of
old time as something noble and exalted, "making believe"
that such aesthetic lack was real self-denial and unworldliness.
It is not surprising that in a riper age of the world, after lifetimes
of this idealization of peasant states of mind, their children
find themselves morally and mentally unprepared for the
responsibilities of citizenship, of high ethical trust and of the
varied ways of a moral world, whose existence their fathers
made believe to ignore and deny.</p>

<p>Women have always occupied in Quakerism a place theoretically
equal to that of the men, in business and religious
affairs. George Fox and his successors declared men and
women equal, inasmuch as the Divine Spirit is in every human
soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>After the influence of the early Friends ceased, the place of
woman began to be circumscribed by new rules, and crystallized
in a reaction under the influence of purely social forces;
so that this most sensible people made women equal to men
in meetings and in religious legislation through a form of
sexual taboo.</p>

<p>Following the custom of many early English meeting
houses, the men and women sat apart, the men on one side of
the middle aisle, and the women on the other, so that men and
women were not equals in the individualist sense, as they are
for instance, in the practice and theory of Socialism, but were
equals in separate group-life; to each sex, grouped apart from
the other, equal functions were supposed to be delegated.
Oblong Meeting House, on Quaker Hill, had seats for two
hundred and fifty people on the ground floor, and in the gallery
for one hundred and fifty more. The men's side was separated
from the women's, of equal size and extent, by wooden
curtains, which could be raised or lowered; so that the whole
building could be one auditorium, with galleries; or the curtains
could be so lowered that no man on the ground floor
could see any woman unless she be a speaker on the "facing
seats"; nor could any young person in the gallery see any one
of the opposite sex; yet a speaker could be heard in all parts.
The curtains could be so fixed, also, that two independent
meetings could be held, each in a separate auditorium, even
the speakers being separated from one another.</p>

<p>It was the custom for women to have delegated to them
certain religious functions, at Monthly Meeting and Quarterly
and Yearly Meetings, on which they deliberated, before submitting
them to the whole meeting. This old Oblong Meeting
House is a mute record and symbol of the century-old contest
of the Puritan spirit among the old Quakers, striving for an
inflexibly right relation between the sexes. They attained
their ends through the creation of a community, but not until
the community dissolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The position of woman among Friends is another eloquent
tribute to the two-fold "dealing" of Quakerism with women. She
is man's equal, but she is man's greatest source of danger. She
must be on a par with him, but she must be apart from him.
The relations of men and women are therefore very interesting.
In doctrinal matters, in discussion, in preaching and "testifying,"
men and women are equal, and the respect that a man
has for his wife or sister or neighbor woman, in these functions
of a devout sort is like that he has for another man.
Generally the men of the Quaker school of influence believe
as a matter of course in the intellectual and juristic equality of
women with men; and in the religious equality of the individual
woman with the individual man. But in the practical arts and
in business a woman is a woman and a man is a man. Here
the women are restricted by convention to housekeeping, which
on large farms is quite enough for them; and the men have the
outdoor life, the "trading," and the gainful occupations&mdash;except
the boarding of city people. There is no especial respect
for the "managing woman" who "runs a farm"; the community
expects such a woman to fail.</p>

<p>Moreover, between the sexes there is no camaraderie, no
companionship of an intellectual sort between husband and
wife, no free exchange of ideas except in circles made up of
the members of one sex. In any public meeting the men habitually
sit apart from their wives and from the women members
of their families, even though the audiences be not bilaterally
halved.</p>

<p>The orbits of man's and woman's lives are separate, though
each ascribes to the individuals of the other sex an ethical and
religious parity. The effect is seen in the diminishing of the
numbers of men on the Hill, in the group-life of the women,
and in the type of woman. It may be well to consider these
in reverse order.</p>

<p>The individual Quaker Hill woman, so far as she differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
from women generally, may be described as a woman almost
perfectly conformed to type, presenting fewer variations than
elsewhere, either in the form of youthful prettinesses and
follies, or in the strenuous opinion of mature years. She is
neither a flirt as a girl, nor a radical as a woman. Color has
not yet come into her maidenly days, nor violence of opinion
into her womanly years. She affects neither fashion nor intellectual
eccentricity. Yet she attains to a better average of reasonable,
sensible action than she could otherwise do. She knows
less of the impulsive, emotional prettiness of adolescence than
women of other country communities, and in later years gives
herself less to intellectual vagaries. Women's rights are established
on the Hill; it is impossible to be strenuous about them.</p>

<p>The numerous groupings and associations of women are
especially interesting in view of the fact that the men of the
Hill have no associations whatever, now that the stores are
closed; and are assembled in no fixed groupings. It has never
been possible, so far as records go, to maintain a society of
men on the Hill. In the early part of the period under study
a literary and debating society was organized, with social attractions;
but it was feeble and short-lived. There are not
enough leaders among the men to make such group-life possible.
They are related by ties of labor, rather than of class-fraternity;
and they have never acquired any interest common
to their sex to assemble them in groups and companies;
the discipline of the religion known to the Hill has discouraged
and outlawed it.</p>

<p>This contrast may have something to do with the departure
of men from the Hill. So long as the stores were in operation,
at Toffey's, Akin's, and Merritt's places, the men could meet
there, and had in their assembling a natural group-life, which
satisfied many with life in the country. But with the closing
of the stores after the coming of the railroad in 1849, this also
failed, and the men having no capacity for general association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with one another, and few interests possessed in common
with the women, have been the more impelled to leave the Hill.
Economic advantage had only to be as good elsewhere, and
the man emigrated. I have not known those who have left
the place, in my knowledge of it, to give as a reason inability
to make a good living there; but always they have spoken
most emphatically of the bareness and lack of interest in the
social life of the Hill as their reason for emigrating to the
city or large town.</p>

<h2 class="chapter3">Part III.</h2>

<h2 style="font-size: 150%; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">The Mixed Community, from 1880 to the Present.</h2>


<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IC" id="CHAPTER_IC"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">DEMOTIC COMPOSITION.</h3>


<p>There are ninety-three dwellings on Quaker Hill, as defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
above, and illustrated in Map II. The shaded area alone
is referred to here as the area proper to the term "Quaker
Hill." In these dwellings live four hundred and five persons.
This gives a density of population of 26.667 per square mile.
In the summer months of July and August there come to the
Hill at least five hundred and nineteen more, increasing the
density of population to more than 61 per square mile.</p>

<p>There is a steady emigration from the Hill, due to the
departure of working-people and their families in search of
better economic opportunities. This has in ten years removed
thirty-nine persons. Death has removed or occasioned the
removal of twenty-seven more, while only three have been
removed by marriage.</p>

<p>Over against this there has been an immigration in the
years 1895-1905 of thirty persons; of whom eleven have
come in to labor, and nineteen for residence on their own
property.</p>

<p>There were resident in 1905 on Quaker Hill the following
social-economic classes: Professional men, three; one minister,
two artists; wealthy business men, three; farmers, thirty-eight;
laborers, forty (heads of houses).</p>

<p>There were fifty-three births in ten years, 1895-1905, of
which fourteen were in the families of property-owners, and
thirty-nine in families of tenants. There were in these ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
years thirty-one deaths, of which twenty-five were in the
families of property-owners, and only six in those of tenants.
Thus the tenant class, bound to the community by no ties of
property, contributed 73 per cent. of the births and only 20
per cent. of the deaths, while the property holders suffered 80
per cent. of the deaths and were increased by only 26.4 per
cent. of the births. The number of persons in the families of
property holders in 1905 was 184, and in those of tenants 221.
These are as one to one and one-fifth. This difference is not
enough to account for the great disparity in births and deaths
between the two classes of families. For, allowing for this
difference, births are two and one-third times as numerous in
the working and landless class as among the landowners; and
deaths are almost three and a half times as many among the
landholders as among their servants and tenants.</p>

<p>The present population of the Hill is of a composition which
is explainable by migration, and by the effect of the topography
of the Hill upon that population. There is every evidence
that before the coming of the railroad in 1849 the population
was unified, and the community freer of neighborhood
groupings. The lists of customers who traded at Daniel
Merritt's store, given in Appendix B of this volume, indicates
the centering on the Hill of a wide economic life. Every
record and tradition of a religious sort indicates that the Oblong
Meeting House was also the center of a religious community
as wide-spread as the business of the stores. The Hill
was one neighborhood until 1828, when the Division of the
Meeting occurred; and 1849, when the railroad came to
Pawling. It is not now one neighborhood. Three groupings
of households may be discerned, roughly designated "The
North End," "Quaker Hill Proper," and "Wing's Corners."
The second of these, being the territory most under scrutiny
in Part III, might again be divided into the territory "up by
the Meeting House," and that "down by Mizzen-Top." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
difficulty one experiences in naming these groupings of houses
is a token of the indefiniteness of these divisions. They are
accentuated by events occurring in the more recent history of
the Hill. The older history which shapes the consciousness of
the community does not know these neighborhood divisions.
Yet the change of the emphasis of travel to the roads running
east and west, from those north and south, has separated these
neighborhoods from one another. "The North End," therefore,
is composed of those households between Sites 1 and 15,
who go to the village of Pawling for "trading" and "to take
the cars," along the road which passes Sites 16 to 18.
They include Hammersley Lake and Hurd's Corners in their
interests.</p>

<p>The "Middle Distance," or as I would call it "The Meeting
House Neighborhood," is composed of those households from
Sites 21 to 41; "the Hotel Neighborhood," of those from Site
42 to 95; and these all, whether regarded as one or as two
sections, go habitually to the village by the "Mizzen-Top road,"
past Sites 99 and 113.</p>

<p>"Wing's Corner" is properly the name of Site 100, but it
may serve for a title of the southern neighborhood from Site
122 to 104. From this neighborhood all travel to the valley
by the road westward from the "Corners."</p>

<p>The "North End" and "Wing's Corners" are settled almost
entirely by Americans, and until within the past two years,
by families derived from the original population. "Quaker
Hill Proper" is the place of residence of the Irish-Americans.
It has been also the place of residence of the last of the
Quakers during the period, just closed, of the Mixed Community.
It is also the territory in which land has the highest
value. Here also are the residences of all the persons of exceptional
wealth.</p>

<p>The community most cherishes the central territory, lying
upon the two miles of road between the Mizzen-Top Hotel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the Meeting House, and extending beyond these points and
on either hand one-half mile. Within this area land is nominally
held at a thousand dollars an acre.</p>

<p>"The proximate causes of demotic composition," says Professor
Giddings,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "are organic variation and migration. The
ultimate causes are to be looked for in the characteristics of
the physical environment." The Quaker Hill population,
drawn originally from a common source, was in 1828 perfectly
homogeneous. The very intensity of the communal life had
effected the elimination of strange and other elements, and
preserved only the Quakers, and those who could live with the
Quakers. Since 1849 this population has become increasingly
heterogeneous. It is not yet a blended stock. There is but
little vital mixture of the elements entering into social and
economic union here. They do not generally intermarry. They
are related only by economic facts and by religious sympathies,
so that the effect of organic variation does not yet appear
among them. But in this chapter the effect of immigration
will be indicated.</p>

<p>The influence of the physical environment is worthy of
brief notice. Between one and another of the three neighborhoods
lie stretches of land, nearly a mile wide, valued less
highly than that on which the clusters of houses stand. In
the days before the railroad, the population passed over this
territory to the centers of the community in the three stores
at Toffey's, Akin's and Muritt's places, and to the Meeting
House. But with the necessity of driving westward to the
railway, the stretches of road passing poorer land had diminished
use, and the clusters of households, once closely related,
ceased to interchange reactions and services; so a segregation
of neighborhoods began, which is increasing with time.</p>

<p>The list of members of the Meeting in Appendix A, and
that of customers of one of the stores in Appendix B, will
serve to show the extent of the community, religious and econ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>omic,
in the eighteenth century. A steady shrinkage has drawn
in the margins of this communal life. At this date Quaker
Hill receives no tribute from any outer territory; and might
be confined to the limits of "Quaker Hill Proper," as some indeed
call the "Middle Distance." The present writer, while
not so limiting the Hill, has omitted both Burch Hill to the
south and the stretches toward Webatuck to the north, which
lie in other towns.</p>

<p>Just a word about neighborhood character. There is no
especial character localized in the Wing's Corners neighborhood.
The central territory has been fully described in this
book, and especially in the chapters on "The Common Mind,"
and "Practical Differences and Resemblances." "The North
End" is the most isolated of any neighborhood included within
the Hill population. Its families are less directly derived from
Quaker stock. The older Quaker families once living there
have disappeared. It is a genial, kindly, chatty neighborhood,
without the exalted sense of past importance or of present
day prestige which affects the manners of "Quaker Hill
Proper." It has, moreover, none of the Irish-American residents,
and until recently no New York families. The seven
family groups resident in these fifteen houses have been long
acquainted, and have become used to one another. A kindly,
tolerant feeling prevails. Gossip is not forbidden. Standards
of conduct are not stretched upon high ideals, and a preference
for enjoyments shows itself in a greater leisure and a laxer
industry than in the central portion of the Hill.</p>

<p>The greater distance from the railway also forbids some
of the activities of "Quaker Hill Proper." The milk wagon
which in 1893-1899 was driven each day from Site 1 to the
railway, gathering up the milk cans on the successive farms,
has been discontinued, and in winter the road between Sites
15 and 21 is often blocked with snow for weeks. The resident
at Site 3 has for about twenty years maintained a slaughter-house
and a wagon for the sale of meat, using his land for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fatting cattle and sheep, and selling the meat along two routes.
The resident at Site 15 maintains a fish-wagon, buying his fish
at the railways and selling at the houses along selected routes,
through the summer. The other residents follow the diversified
farming, based on grazing, which in this country includes
fatting of calves and pigs, raising of poultry and other small
agricultural industries. One family only in this neighborhood
takes boarders in the summer.</p>

<p>The peculiar religious character of Quaker Hill had by
1880 drawn in its margins to "Quaker Hill Proper," though
the population in these outlying neighborhoods had a passive
acquiescence in it. They still respond to the activities which
are centered in the focal neighborhood. Of themselves, none
of these neighborhoods originates any religious activity.</p>

<p>In this connection mention should be made of the Connecticut
neighborhood known as Coburn, in which a certain relation
to Quaker Hill has always been maintained. It is not here
regarded as a Quaker Hill neighborhood. Its characteristics
are those of Connecticut, and its traditions are not Quaker, in
a pure sense; but Quaker Hill has influenced it not a little,
religiously. In Coburn remains a measurable deposit of
Quaker Hill population.</p>

<p>Among the changes wrought by the railroad was the introduction
of new social elements into the community. The
Quaker population had become divided into rich and poor,
but all were of the same general stock. The parents of all
had the same experience to relate. Their fathers had come
to Quaker Hill in the early or middle part of the eighteenth
century, had endured together the hardships of pioneer days,
had known the "unity" of Quaker discipline for one hundred
years, and had held loyally to the ideas and standards
of Quakerism.</p>

<p>With the approach of the railroad came Irish laborers,
who settled first in the valley below, generally in the limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of Pawling village, and later came on the Hill as workers on
the farms in the new forms of dairy industry to which the
farmers were stimulated by the railroad. This immigration
continued from 1840 until 1860. In that time, a period of
about twenty years, there came laborers for almost all the
farmers on the Hill. I am informed that in the decade following
the Civil War the work on all the farms, "from
Wing's corner to the North End," was done by young
Irishmen.</p>

<p>The first Irishmen of this immigration whose names appear
upon the tax-lists of the town of Pawling are Owen and
Patrick Denany, who are assessed upon one hundred acres in
1845, the land upon which they first settled being in the western
part of the town. These two brothers came before the
railroad was extended to Pawling, in 1840. In 1867 Patrick
moved to Quaker Hill and bought a place, midway between
Sites 128 and 131. Thomas Guilshan in 1858 and years following
was taxed upon nine acres, the land upon which his
widow still lives, at Site 93. John Brady lived for years at
Site 71, and in a house now removed except for traces of a
cellar, about fifty feet southeast of the Akin Free Library,
lived Charles Kiernan. Among the earliest Irish Catholics
came James Cullom and Margaret, his wife, who acquired
land at Site 34. Other names of the earlier Irish generations
are Hugh Clark, who acquired land at Site 116, James Rooney,
Fergus Fahey, James Doyle, Kate Leary, James Hopper, who
settled in Pawling or Hurd's Corner, and David Burns, who
became a landowner at Site 117.</p>

<p>The Irish Catholics early differentiated into two classes,
only one of which, with their children, remains to the present
day. There were the "loose-footed fellows," who followed
the railroad, worked for seasons on the farms, drifted on with
the renewal of demand for railroad laborers, and disappeared
from the Hill. Their places were taken, in the years follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ing
1880, by American laborers, and a very few other foreigners,
of whom I will speak below. The other class of
Irish Catholics sought to own land. The details given above
indicate their promptness in acquiring interest in the soil.
From them has been recruited almost all the present Catholic
population of the Hill, which in 1905 amounted in all to
twenty-five households and one hundred persons.</p>

<p>Whereas the early immigration of Irish worked in all the
dairies from one end of the Hill to the other, the land owned
by Irish-Americans now is all in the central portion of the
Hill, within a radius of one mile from Mizzen-Top Hotel.
Within this mile also all the Irish laborers employed on
the Hill are at work. They are employed about the Hotel, on
the places of the wealthier landowners of the Hill, and in such
independent trades as stone-mason, blacksmith or wheelwright.
Only an occasional Irish-American is found among the hired
hands on the dairy farms.</p>

<p>In contrast to the indifference of the original population
of the town to education, it is worthy of note that the grandson
of an Irish-American named above promises at this writing
to be the first youth born in the town to graduate from a
higher institution of learning, being in his last year at West
Point.</p>

<p>The Irish population who have remained on the Hill are
singularly homogeneous, and thoroughly imbued with the
spirit of the place. In the chapter on "The Ideals of the New
Quakerism," I have commented on Irish acquisition of a character
like that of the Quakers. The gentleness of manner,
the quickness of social sympathy and the industrious quietness
of the Quakers have come to be theirs. Yet they are
loyal Catholics, and with very few exceptions support their
Church in the village regularly. Many of them who have
not conveyances have for years employed a stage-driver to
transport them on Sunday morning to St. Bernard's Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
This church has been built by the Irish and Irish-Americans.
At the time of their coming in 1840-1850, there was no Catholic
church, and "if you wanted to hear mass said, you had to
drive to Poughkeepsie." Later, a tent was erected for a time,
for the Catholic services, then a Baptist church building was
purchased. This building was destroyed by fire about 1875,
and the present structure in the village was erected.</p>

<p>The Catholic population of the Hill is now equal to the
Quaker population, there being of each twenty-five households;
the old and the new. But each has gone through striking
changes since the Catholics came, sixty years ago. "When
I was a boy," says a prominent Irish-American, "you could
hardly see the road here for the carriages and the dust, all of
them Quakers going to the Old Meeting House, on Sunday,
or to Quarterly Meeting. But now they are all gone." The
religious faithfulness of those Friends of two generations ago
has descended upon no part of the population more fully than
upon the handful of Catholic families, who now drive to Pawling
every Sunday in great wagon-loads, while the members
of the Quaker households have closed their meeting houses
forever.</p>

<p>Of the Irish-Catholic population here described only eleven
are Irish born. The rest, about ninety in number, are American
born of Irish parents.</p>

<p>The other elements who have been adopted into the Quaker
Hill population are small in number in comparison with the
Irish. They are among the working people, one Swiss, two
Poles, who have bought small places at Sites 42 and 75, respectively;
and two New York ladies who about 1890 purchased
places at Sites 41 and 35, who have become a strong
influence, being socially and religiously in sympathy with the
original Quaker population. Their influence is described in
the chapter upon "The Common Mind of the Mixed Community."
Purchases of land have been made in the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
1905-1907, more than in the preceding decade, by persons coming
from outside the Quaker Hill population, all of the buyers
being from New York City. These purchases are all upon
the outer fringes of the Hill territory, at Sites 107, 108, 111,
118, in the southwestern part, and Sites 6 and 10 in the
"North End," and in the Coburn neighborhood, Sites 88 and
others near the Meeting House, Site 139. The land in the
central section has changed hands, in the years 1890-1907,
only through the increase in the holdings of those who owned
large estates before the period of the Mixed Community.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IIC" id="CHAPTER_IIC"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE ECONOMY OF HOUSE AND FIELD.</h3>


<p>The hospitality of the Quakers is worthy of a treatise, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the critical order, but poetic and imaginative. It cannot be
described in mere social analysis. It has grown out of their
whole order of life, and expresses their religious view, as well
as their economic habits. I showed in Chapter VII, Part I,
that the hospitality of the Friends acquired religious importance
from their belief that in every man is the Spirit of God.
With the simplicity, and direct adherence to a few truths, which
characterized the early Friends this belief was practiced, and
became one of the religious customs of the Society. They
entertained travellers, "especially such as were of the household
of faith." They made it a religious tenet to house and welcome
"Friends travelling on truth's account."</p>

<p>With equal directness they proceeded further to welcome
every traveller, and to endure often the intrusions of those who
would not be desired as guests, because they believed that such
might be acting by the divine impulse.</p>

<p>The hospitality, therefore, of such a community is very
beautiful. For they have their ways of asserting themselves, in
spite of non-resistance. They open their doors, they set their
table, with a religious spirit. A thoroughness characterizes all
their household arrangements, a grace is given to all their
housekeeping, which infuses an indescribable content into the
experiences of a guest in these homes. Their hospitality to one
another has been therefore a powerful enginery for continuing
and for extending the domains of Quakerism.</p>

<p>On Quaker Hill the living generations have known this
hospitality in two notable ways only, in the Quarterly Meetings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and in the transformed hospitality of the boarding-house. The
Quarterly Meeting is now gone from the Hill. Both the Hicksite
Meeting, which was "laid down" in 1885, and the Orthodox
Meeting, which ceased to meet in 1905, brought in their day
to the Hill, once in the year, an inundation of guests, who
stayed through the latter days of a week, and then went their
way, to meet quarterly throughout the year, but in other places,
until the season came again for Quaker Hill.</p>

<p>The Quaker Hill Quarterly was in August, and "after
haying." "The roads were full of the Quakers going up to
the Meeting House." In every Quaker home they were welcomed,
whether they had written to announce their coming, or
whether they had not. All through the days of the Meeting,
they would renew the old ties, and discuss the passing of the
Society, the interests of the Kingdom, as they saw it, "the
things of the spirit."</p>

<p>They meet no more. In the Quarterly Meeting, which
comprises the Monthly Meetings of an area comparable to
Dutchess County, there are still some Friends, and some meetings
which are not "laid down." But they come no more, at
"Quarterly Meeting time" to Quaker Hill. Many of the older
members are dead. Of the younger members many have only
a passive adherence to Quakerism, only sufficient to excuse
them from undesirable worldliness, and from irksome responsibility
in other religious bodies.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the old Quaker assemblings has passed
over into the business of boarding city people. The same table
is set, the same welcome given; but to the paid guest.</p>

<p>The passing of the old hospitality of the Friends was illustrated
in the years of the writer's residence on the Hill, in
the person of an old peddler, known as Charles Eagle. It had
been the ancient custom to entertain any and every wayfarer;
and Eagle journeyed from South to North about once a
month in the warmer seasons, for many years. He had en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>joyed
the entertainment of the Quakers, following the ancient
line of their settlements along the Oblong, and stopping overnight
in their ample, kindly households. He carried a pack
on his back and another large bundle in his hand. His pace
was slow, like that of an ox, but untiring and unresting, hour
after hour. His person, sturdy and short, was clothed in
overall stuff, elaborately patched and mended. At first sight
it seemed to be patched from use and age; but closer inspection
showed that the patches were deliberately sewed on the
new material. He wore a straw hat in summer, decorated
with a bright ribbon, in which were flowers in season. He
wore also a red wig, tied under his chin with a ribbon. His
face was like that of an Indian, with broad cheek-bones and
small shifting eyes.</p>

<p>Eagle was French, and professed to be a refugee, a person
of interest to foreign monarchs. On the inner wrapping of
his pack was written large, "Vive le Napoleon! Vive la
France! Vive!" He had little hesitation about speaking of
himself, though always with stilted courtesy, and always
furtively.</p>

<p>He made a study of astronomy, and every night would ask
his hostess, with much apology but firm insistence, for a
pitcher of water, and for the privilege that he might retire
early to his room, open the window and view the stars.
Strange to say, in this he was not merely eccentric; for his
reading was of the latest books on the science, and he exchanged
with Akin Hall Library a Young's Astronomy for a
Newcomb's, in 1898. He accompanied the presentation of the
later book, in which was the author's name inscribed with a
note to Mr. Eagle, with a demonstration of a theory of the
Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>Eagle never tried to sell his goods on the Hill, and indeed
it is doubtful if he carried them for any other purpose than
to conceal his real commodities, which were watches. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
these he carried a good selection of the better and of the
cheaper sorts, all concealed in the center of his pack, among
impossible dry goods and varied fancy wares.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to rob him, or at least to annoy
him, by some young men; and he shot one of his assailants.
For this offence he was, after trial, sent to the Asylum for
the Criminal Insane.</p>

<p>His earlier journeys over the Hill found him a welcome
guest at the Quaker homes. But the substitution of boarding
for the ancient hospitality made the peddler unwelcome; and
he passed through without stopping in his later years.</p>

<p>The Quarterly Meeting of the Society of Friends was the
annual culmination of the hospitality of the Hill population.
Coming in August, "after haying," it was for a century and
a half the great assembly of the people of the Hill, and of their
kindred and friends; and until the Orthodox Meeting ceased
to meet, in 1905, there was Quarterly Meeting in the smaller
Meeting House. The old hospitality was never diminished
by the Quakers as long as their meetings continued. Even
though the same house were filled with paying boarders, the
family retreated to the attic, the best rooms were devoted to
the "Friends travelling on truth's account;" and the same
house saw hospitality of the old sort extended for one week to
the religious guests, and of the new sort faithfully set forth
for the guests who paid for it by the week.</p>

<p>The Quakeress and daughter of Quakers has produced the
summer boarding-house; which is no more than the ample
Quaker home, organized to extend the thrifty hospitality continuously
for four months, for good payment in return, which
has always been extended to Friends and visiting relatives for
longer or shorter periods in the past, as an act of household
grace.</p>

<p>The Quaker Hill woman is a good housekeeper. The substantial
farmhouses on the Hill are outward signs of excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
homes within. The table is well spread, with a measured
abundance, which satisfies but does not waste. The rooms are
each furnished forth in spare and righteous daintiness,
over which nowadays is poured, in occasional instances, a
pretty modern color, timidly laid on, which does not remove
the prim Quakerness. Ventures in the use of decoration, however,
have been crude in most cases, and the results, so
far as they have been effected by the taste of the woman of
the Hill, are incongruous in color, and ill-assorted in design.
It is in house-furnishing that the tendency of the daughter of
the Quakers shows the most frequent variation. Occasionally
one sees the outcropping of a really artistic spirit&mdash;peculiarly
refreshing because so rare&mdash;which has only in a woman's
mature years ventured to indulge in a bit of happy color; but
the venture if successful is always reserved and simple; and
the most of such ventures are of unhappy result.</p>

<p>The housekeeping arts have reached a high degree of perfection
on the Hill. Cooking is there done with a precision,
economy and tastefulness in sharp contrast to the non-aesthetic
manner in which the Quakers conduct most occupations. It is,
moreover, a kind of cooking after the Quaker manner, at once
frugal and abundant. For of all people, the Quakers have
learned to manage generously and economically.</p>

<p>The outcome of this housekeeping is the diversion of much
of the business energy of the Hill to the "keeping of boarders."
Seven of the old Quaker families, and one Irish Catholic
household are devoted to the keeping of boarders; five of them
being supported in the main by this business. Of these five
families, however, four reside upon farms of more than one
hundred and fifty acres apiece. These families sell at certain
times in the year, a certain quantity of milk, or make butter,
or fatten calves, but not as their central means of support.</p>

<p>To these farmhouses come year after year the same paying
guests, each house having its own constituency, built up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
through thirty years of patient and unbroken service. The
charm of the Quaker character, the excellence of the cooking
and the enjoyable character of the other factors of the household,
bring patrons back; while the benefits of the elevation
and pure air are, to city dwellers, material returns for the
moneys expended. For this board, the price charged is, in the
Irish Catholic household, five dollars per week; in one of the
oldtime Quaker houses, six dollars, and in the others from
eight to ten or twelve dollars per week.</p>

<p>The season in which boarders can be secured in paying
numbers is a period extending from June fifteenth to
October first, with the houses filled only in the months of July
and August. For this period, which is one continued strain
upon the housekeepers and their aids, preparation begins as
early as the month of March. The housework is generally
done by the women of the family, with some employed help,
of an inferior sort. The horses and carriages on the farm
must be used for the transportation of guests, and for hire to
those who drive for pleasure. On one farm sheep are kept;
though most of the boarding-houses buy their meat supplies
of the dealers mentioned below.</p>

<p>Of late years the help employed in these boarding-houses,
in addition to members of the family, has come to be negroes
from Culpepper County, Virginia. These employees come
each spring and return in the fall.</p>

<p>The one Irish Catholic boarding-house is for the entertainment
of the hired men on the lower part of the Hill, near
the Hotel. It is maintained throughout the year, with a varying
number of guests, by a woman ninety years of age, who
in addition to the management, does much of the hard work
herself.</p>

<p>The conservatism of the Hill families is shown in the fact
that the boarding-house business has never been extended. No
house has ever been erected for that purpose alone; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
present business of that sort is carried on in the old Quaker
homes, each receiving only as many paid guests as it was used
to receive of its hospitable duty, when the Quarterly Meeting
brought Friends from afar, once in the year.</p>

<p>Mizzen-Top Hotel is perhaps an exception, if, indeed, a
large hotel, with quarters for two hundred and fifty guests,
and at prices ranging from three dollars per day up, be an
exception. It has grown out of the same conditions which
transformed the farmhouses into boarding-houses, save that it
has never been managed at a profit, and they never at a loss.
It is, however, an institution by itself, and will be treated in
another place.</p>

<p>The Mizzen-Top Hotel has always been a sober institution,
influenced thereto by the pleasureless spirit of the Hill. Baseball,
tennis, and golf in their times have had vogue there, but
under every management it has been hard to arouse and maintain
active interest in outdoor or indoor sports. The direct
road to Hammersley Lake, formerly called Quaker Hill Pond,
has made possible a moderate indulgence in carriage-driving.
The laying out of the golf links in 1897 set going that dignified
sport, just as the Wayside Path in 1880 occasioned some
mild pedestrianism. But the Hotel diminishes rather than increases
in its play-activities; and only games of cards retain
a hold upon the guests, who prefer the piazza, the croquet
ground, the tennis court, and the golf links in rapidly diminishing
proportion.</p>

<p>Intemperance was common in earlier times, and drinking
was universal. Every household made and stored for winter
many barrels of cider. Rum and wine were freely bought
at the store. Their use in the harvest field was essential to
the habits of agriculture which preceded the times of the
mower and reaper. This free use of cider, with accompanying
intemperance, survives in only two houses on Quaker Hill.</p>

<p>Miss Taber's account, in "Some Glimpses of the Past," de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>scribes
the drinking habits of the older period: "It was customary
to have cider on the table at every meal, the ladies
would have their tea, but most of the men drank cider largely,
many to excess, consequently there were great quantities made
in the fall and stored in the cellars during the winter. A
large farmer would lay out a great deal of work, gathering
from ten to twenty cartloads of apples, hooping and cleaning
barrels, and many ground and pressed their own cider, then
the large casks were drawn to and placed in the cellars. This
usually occupied a large part of the month of October. In
the spring a portion of the hard cider would be taken to a
distiller, and made into cider brandy to be used in the haying
and harvest field, at sheep washings, butchering, raisings,
shearings and on many occasions. Some was always on the
sideboard and often on the table. In most households there
were sideboards well furnished with spirits, brandy, homemade wine,
metheglin, etc., which were offered to guests. It
was a fashion or custom to offer a drink of some kind whenever
a neighbor called.</p>

<p>"My grandfather being obliged to have so many men at
least two months each year became disgusted with the custom
of furnishing so much cider and spirits to the men in the
field, as many of them would come to the house at supper
time without any appetite and in a quarrelsome mood. There
would be wrestlings and fighting during the evening and the
chain in the well could be heard rattling all night long. So
one year, probably about 1835 or '36, he decided that he would
do it no longer. His brother and many of his neighbors tried
to dissuade him and prophesied that he would not be able
to get sufficient help to secure his crops, but he declared he
would give up farming before he would endure it any longer,
and announced when securing his extra help for that summer
that he would furnish no cider or spirits in the field, but that
coffee and other drinks would be carried out and that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
man should have a ration of spirits at each meal. Most of the
men he had had in past years came back and seemed to be glad
to be out of the way of temptation. The next year he dispensed
with the ration at meal times, and the custom grew
among his neighbors with surprising rapidity; it was but a
few years when it became general, with a few exceptions,
where the farmer himself was fond of it, until to-day such a
thing is not heard of, and in fact, the farmer, like the railroads
and other large corporations, do not care to employ a man
that is in the habit of using spirits at all."</p>

<p>In the years 1890-1905 there were only two families on
the Hill which followed primitive custom in "putting in cider"
into the cellar in quantity for the winter. In five more a very
small quantity was kept. In the other cases it was regarded
as immoral to use the beverage. The writer was only once
offered a drink of alcoholic beverage in six years' residence
on the Hill.</p>

<p>In respect to the standard of living which is regarded as
necessary to the maintenance of respect and social position,
the Hill exhibits two strata of the population. The city people,
and the farmers and laborers. The former class, besides the
Hotel and its cottages, comprise seven households, who have
formed their ways of living upon the city standard. The
others, resident all the year round upon the Hill, live after a
standard common to American country-people generally of
the better class.</p>

<p>The economic ideas and habits are in no way peculiar to
the Hill. There survive in a few old persons some primitive
industrial habits. One old lady, now about ninety, amuses herself
with spinning, knitting and weaving; keeping alive all the
primitive processes from the shearing of sheep in her son's
field to the completed garment. Axe-helves are still made by
hand in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The practical arts of the community are agriculture, es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>pecially
the cultivation of grass for hay, cooking and general
housekeeping, and the entertainment of paid guests, as "boarders"
in farmhouse and hotel. There is in addition on one
farm, at Site No. 3, a slaughter-house, at which beef and
mutton and pork are prepared for market, the animals being
bought, pastured, fattened and killed on the place, and the
meat delivered to customers, especially in the summer months,
by means of a wagon, which makes its journey twice a week,
over the length of the Hill and in the country eastward.</p>

<p>There is also a fish-wagon owned and maintained by the
resident at Site No. 15, which buys fish during the year and
maintains by means of a wagon a similar trade. These two
are the only food supply businesses maintained on the Hill.</p>

<p>Economic opportunity has always appealed strongly to
the Quaker Hill man and woman. In 1740 John Toffey settled
at the crossing of ways which is called "Toffey's Corners,"
and began to make hats. Other industries followed.</p>

<p>In recent years, in almost every Quaker house boarders
have been taken, and a better profit has been made than from
the sale of milk. For twenty-five years the Mizzen-Top Hotel,
accommodating two hundred and fifty guests, has represented
notably this response to opportunity. The beautiful scenery,
which the Quaker himself does not appreciate, because he has
educated himself out of the appreciation of color and form, has
offered him an opportunity of profit which he has been prompt
and diligent to seize. All through the summer every one of
the six largest Quaker homesteads is filled with guests. The
fact cited above that in the summer there comes to the Hill a
greater transient population than dwells there through the
year, a population of guests, illustrates this lively economic
alertness.</p>

<p>The emigration from the Hill since 1840 of so many persons,
notably the younger and more ambitious, is in itself a token
of this response. The railroad brought the opportunity; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ambitious accepted it; many whole families have disappeared.
Their strong members emigrated; the weaker stock died out.
The Merritt, Vanderburgh, Irish, Wing, Sherman, Akin, and
other families offer examples. In the place of those who departed
have come others, to fill the total population. There
were in 1905 on the Hill twenty-five old families with seventy-five
persons, and twenty-five Irish Catholic families with one
hundred persons.</p>

<p>The response to economic opportunity has often been too
keen, and the attempt too grasping. In 1891 wealthy New
Yorkers offered for certain farms so located as to command
beautiful views, prices almost double what they are worth for
farming. The reply was a demand in every case of one thousand
dollars more than was offered; and the result was&mdash;no
sale.</p>

<p>Land is valued, though few sales are made, at $1,000 per
acre, near the Hotel. The acre numbered 42, one mile from
Mizzen-Top, on Map II, was sold in 1893 to a laboring man
for $250. At 53, land was sold in 1903 for $700 per acre.
At 52, three acres were sold by sisters to a brother in 1895,
the asking-price being $1,000 per acre, and the price paid $800
per acre. For farming, this land is worth $50 and $75
per acre. Four miles further inland as good recently sold for
$10 per acre. Quaker Hill has not neglected its economic
opportunities.</p>

<p>Nearness to the soil has, under the influences of Quaker
ethics and economic ambition, cultivated in this population a
patient and steadfast industry, which expresses itself in the
milk dairy, a form of farming by its nature requiring early
hours and late, with all the day between filled by various duties.
I have shown above that this industry is losing its hold on
the farmers of the Hill, but for two generations it has been
the distinctive type of labor on the Hill. To rise at four or
even earlier in the morning and to prepare the milk, to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it at the station, four to eight miles away, to attend to the wants
of cows from twenty to one hundred in number; to prepare the
various food-products, either by raising from the soil, or by
carting from the railroad,&mdash;these activities filled, ten years
ago, the lives of one hundred and four of the adult males of
the community; and these activities at present fill the time of
sixty of the adult males of the community.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>While "the milk business" is a declining industry, other
things are not less engrossing. The land must be tilled, and
is tilled. Hay is the greatest crop, and the mere round of
the seasons brings for a community used to agriculture a discipline
and a course of labor, which make life regular and
industrious.</p>

<p>Farming, as stated above, is carried on with a view to the
production of milk for the city market. It is a laborious and
exacting occupation. The dairy cow, generally of the Holstein
stock, or with a strain of Holstein in her blood, is the
most common variety; though the grass of the Hill is so good
that very rich milk is produced by "red cow, just plain farmer's
cow," as the local description runs; and the demands of the
middlemen have brought in some Jersey cattle, which are
desired, because of the greater proportion of cream they
produce. The largest profit from the "making of milk" is
secured by those farmers who keep as many cows as can be
fed from the land owned by them. But the more ambitious
farmers rent land, and in a few cases on a small farm keep so
many cattle that they have to buy even hay and corn. It is
necessary for the farmer, in order to meet the demands of the
city market, to feed his cattle on grains not raised on the Hill.
One hundred years ago the lands of the Hill were planted in
wheat, rye, corn and other grains, but to-day the farmers buy
all grains, except corn, of which an increasing quantity is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>being raised, and oats, of which they do not raise enough for
the use of their horses. There are no silos used on the Hill,
the city milkmen having a standing objection to the milk of
cows fed on ensilage.</p>

<p>The labor problem created by the milk business is an acute
one. One man can milk not more than twenty cows, and he
is a stout farm-hand who can daily milk more than twelve
or fifteen. As a farmer must keep between twenty and forty
cows to do justice to his acreage, on the average Hill farm,
there must be at least two men, and often there must be five
or six men employed on the farm. To secure this number of
capable men, to keep them, and to pay them are hard problems.
Their wages have risen in the past twelve years, from fourteen
dollars a month and board to twenty-three dollars and board;
or for a married man, who has house rent, wood, and time
to cut it, garden and time to tend it, and a quart of milk a
day, the wages have risen from twenty-eight to thirty-five dollars
a month.</p>

<p>These men are recruited from a class born in the country,
and of a drifting, nomadic spirit; and from the city, the latter
a sinister, dangerous element, whom the farmers fear and suspect.
On a large farm, with five men in employ, the farmer
may expect to replace one man each month; and to replace his
whole force at least once a year. So changeable are the minds
of this class of laborers.</p>

<p>Those who are married are somewhat more stable; but of
the others it is asserted by the farmers that out of their wages
they save nothing.</p>

<p>There has been a rise in the price secured by the farmers
for their milk in the past ten years, but it has been only for
limited periods. The variation was from 1.9 cents and 2 cents,
the price in 1895-98, to 3 cents, the price paid in the winter of
1907. In the summer the price is always lower. The farmers
have no control over the price paid them for milk, nor have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
they control over the prices to be paid for labor, though of
course in this matter, there is room for a certain skill in bargaining
and for the lowering of the total wages paid on the
farm through the skillful employment of the cheaper kinds of
hands.</p>

<p>There is also a difference in the price paid for milk by
"the Milk Factory," a plant established at the railway in the
past ten years, in each dairy-town. This establishment takes
milk from the poorer dairies under conditions less exacting
than are laid down by some buyers, and in consequence pays
a price correspondingly lower than the market rates for milk
and the higher prices secured by the better farmers.</p>

<p>One energetic farmer, who has in the past five years had
large farms to manage, on hire, or on shares, has prepared
milk for hospital use in the city, meeting the exactions of inspection,
and the prescribed care of stables, animals, workmen
and receptacles in a way intolerable to the average farmer.
He receives in return a price twenty per cent above the
market rate.</p>

<p>The effect of the above conditions is seen in the fact that
in the twelve years under study nine owners of large farms
have "given up the milk business," have sold their cows, or
keeping them have made butter and fatted calves for market.
The profits to be made in dairy-farming are so small, unless
the farmer conduct his dairy in an exceptional manner, or on
a very large scale, that the average man on the Hill cannot
continue it. Indeed, the average farmer on the Hill is unable
through lack of vitality or incapacity for application, to conduct
any business, successfully, against competition. The state
of mind of such men, in the worst cases, is illustrated by the
remark of one of them who approached a successful dairyman,
saying: "I am going to cease to make milk for the city
market, and I thought I would come to you and find out
something about the way to make butter&mdash;not the best butter,
such as you make, but a sort of second-class butter."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">NEW IDEALS OF QUAKERISM: ASSIMILATION OF STRANGERS.</h3>


<p>Quaker Hill has always been a community with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
powers of assimilation. The losses suffered by emigration
have been repaired by the genius of the community for
socializing. Whoever comes becomes a loyal learner of the
Quaker Hill ways. I think this is a matter of imitation. Personality
has here made a solemn effort to perfect itself for a
century and a half; and the characters of Richard Osborn,
James J. Vanderburgh, Anne Hayes, David Irish and his
daughter, Phoebe Irish Wanzer, ripened into possession of
at least amazing power of example. I must be sparing of
illustration here, where too rich a store is at hand. I will
offer only this striking fact, observed by all who know the
Hill: the Irish emigrant and his American-born children, of
whom there are now as many as remain of the original
Quakers, have come to be as good Quakers in character&mdash;though
still loyal Catholics in dogma&mdash;as if they said "thee
and thou," and wore drab. They are peaceable, gentle folk,
sober and inoffensive; and the transforming influence of
Quaker character is seen in certain of them in a marked
degree.</p>

<p>The same statement may be made of the pervasive example
of the Quaker character upon other areas of population; servants
who come from the city, summer guests, artistic people
who love the Hill for its beauty and suggestiveness, ministers
and other public teachers who come hither.</p>

<p>The area to the southeast, called "Coburn," settled to a
degree by those who have worked on the Hill in times past as
employees, is touched with the same manner. Its meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
house, erected over sixty years ago, even retains the Quaker
way of seating the men and women apart.</p>

<p>The Quaker Hill Conference, now in its ninth year, is
another illustration of the charm and reach of the gentle influence
of the Quaker Hill ideal upon personal character.</p>

<p>Suggestion also explains much. In such a social whole,
manners and customs are fixed. The newcomer is often fresh,
ingenuous, and sometimes intrusive. Little by little he becomes
socialized. Ways of action are fixed for him, and a range of
performance comes to be his. In harmony with this range,
suggestion is very fertile; but one learns after a time that there
is a limit to its force beyond which individuals will not go.
Suggestion, to be effective upon the many, must come from
the sources which embody the community's religious and economic
ideal.</p>

<p>Ideas, once broached, are usually, if they contemplate action,
opposed, at least by inertness; but after a time they reappear
as if native to the minds which would have none of them by
reasonable approaches. This process is accelerated if the suggestion
begins to travel from mind to mind. Some individuals
are less slow than others; and the leaders of Quaker Hill
thinking have always been able to work by the plan of academic
proposal&mdash;to avoid rejection&mdash;followed by incitement of popular
action in particular quarters. Quaker Hill cannot bear
to be divided; and that which comes to be successful in one
quarter soon comes to be universal. Things can be done by
social suggestion which could never be accomplished by appeal
or rational discussion.</p>

<p>The word that has formed the social mind of Quaker Hill
has been, not "the Spirit," not "the inner light," but "orthodoxy"
or "plainness." For this community, it must be remembered,
had no great thinkers. It discouraged study, stiffened
reason in formulas and dissolved thinking in vision. To its
formulas the Hill has been exceedingly devoted. He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
upheld them was accepted, and he who rejected them, as well
as he who ignored them, was to the early Quaker Hill as if
he did not exist.</p>

<p>This shibboleth has indeed always been religious. Even
to-day the way of direct access to the common heart is a religious
one. Catholic as well as Protestant, Quaker no more
and no less than "the world's people," welcome religious
approaches, respect confessions, and believe experiences. Nothing
can assemble them all which does not originate in religion
and clothe itself in religious sanction. History is religious
history. Business prosperity is approved when the prosperity
has followed religious profession.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that there are not other symbols
than those of religion. Prosperity has spoken its shibboleths
as well as orthodoxy. "Business is business" on Quaker Hill.
Not "to save money" is an unforgiven sin&mdash;and a rare one!</p>

<p>Much has been done in forming the common mind of
Quaker Hill by antipathies and sympathies, chiefly again of
a religious order modified by the economic. The community
is markedly divided into rich and poor, and into orthodox and
not-orthodox. These have no inclination one to another. Each
group has its symbols and pass-words, and while neighborly,
and answering to certain appeals to which the community has
always responded, each resident of the Hill lives and dwells
in his own group and has no expectation of moving out of it.
So long as a man stays in his group he is, by a balancing of
antipathy and sympathy, respected and valued. If he venture
to be other than what he was born to be, he suffers all the
social penalties of a highly organized community.</p>

<p>Authority, working along the lines of belief and dogma,
has almost irresistible force for the Quaker Hill social mind.
A visitor to the Hill said "These are an obedient people." Any
barrenness of the Hill is to be attributed rather to the lack
of leaders who could speak to the beliefs and in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the dogmas, than to lack of willingness to obey authority.
From the past the families on the Hill inherit their willingness
respectively to command and to obey. This is true socially
of certain families and religiously of others. That to-day some
are not led is due solely to the decadence of initiative in the
households which, by reason of wealth or dogmatic rectitude,
inherit and claim the first place.</p>

<p>It was said above that Quaker Hill has shown great power
of assimilating foreign material, and of causing newcomers to
be possessed of the communal spirit. The agency which from
the first accomplished this was religious idealization, embodied
in the meeting, the dress, language and manners of
Friends. Generally the Meeting was recruited from births,
and members were such by birthright. In former times the
community and the Meeting were one. This assimilating of
foreign material by social imitation to the Quaker type, and
into organic subjection to the Quaker Hill community, was
wrought by six agencies. They were language, manners,
costume, amusements, worship, and morals. In each of these
the Quakers were peculiar. In the use of the "plain language"
the Quakers had a machinery of amazing and subtle fascination
for holding the attention, purifying the speech, and
disciplining the whole deportment of the young and the newcomer.
No one has ever been addressed with the use of his
first name by grave, sweet ladies and elderly saints, without
its beginning an influence and exerting a charm he could not
resist; the more so that the Quaker in so doing is guarding
his own soul, rather than seeking to save his hearer.</p>

<p>The grave manners of the Quakers, both in meeting and
without, are framed upon their belief that all days are holy,
and all places sacred. Their long and triumphant fight against
amusements is a tribute to the gravity of life. The contest
to which I have elsewhere referred for pure morals, in matters
of sex, of property and of speech, was a victorious battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>In all these matters Quaker Hill was a population socialized
by religion. Central to it all was the worship of the
Meeting on First Day, and on other occasions; and the great
solemnity of the annual Quarterly Meeting. Fascinated by
that "silence that can be felt," men came from far. They
would come as readily to-day. They went away under the
domination of that idea of pure and spiritual faith, which
kept a whole houseful of men silent for an hour in communion.</p>

<p>As I have looked into this matter it has seemed to me that
the induction to be drawn from the history of Quaker Hill is
this: Religion was a true organizing power for this social
population. Whatever the meeting determinedly strove to do
it accomplished. If it had tried to do more it would have
succeeded.</p>

<p>This was a gain, moreover, without corresponding losses;
a total net gain in all the moralities. The whole area on which
this meeting exerted its influence was by it elevated to a
higher moral and social tone, and organized into a communal
whole, characterized by a loftier and cleaner standard than
that of surrounding populations.</p>

<p>Why, then, did it die out? First, because of the bareness
of its worship, the lack of music, color and form; through
which it lost in the nineteenth century some of its best
families. Then through dogmatic differences, of no interest
to human beings, it lost its primacy in the community and so
its authority.</p>

<p>In the chapter on "Ideals of the Quakers," I have dwelt
upon their dramatization of life. They "made believe" that
"plainness" was sanctity. They fixed their minds upon the
commonplace as the ideal. It is probable that the early population
were men and women of no such talents as to disturb
this conviction; and the variations from plainness in the direction
of gayety were sternly denounced as immoral. Also the
struggle with the wilderness occupied and exhausted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
powers of the exceptional as well as of the average man. But
when with wealth came leisure, there were born sons of the
Quakers who rebelled against the discipline of life that repressed
variation, who demanded self-expression in dress, in
language, in tastes, and in pleasures. Gradually but surely,
as the outside world was brought nearer, these persons were
influenced in their restiveness by books and examples, by imitation
and other stimuli from new sources, until they cast off
in their minds the Quaker ideal of plainness. To be ordinary
no longer seemed to them a way of goodness. They were
oppressed and stifled by the ban of the meeting upon variation.
And though the ideal of plainness has subtly ruled
them even in their rebellion and freedom, it has done so by
its negative power, in that the community has never furnished
exceptional education. The positive dominion of the meeting
broken, the negative "plainness" of the community rules all
the children of the Hill to this day. So few are the sources
of individual variation furnished, in the form of books, music,
education, art, that no son or daughter of Quaker Hill has
attained a place of note even in New York State. The ideal
of "plainness" has been an effectual restraint.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_IVC" id="CHAPTER_IVC"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE COMMON MIND.</h3>


<p>The common mind has been formed to a great degree by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
strong personalities; for the common mind has held an ideal
of perfection in a person. The force which at the beginning
assembled its elements was personal. The type represented
by George Fox, as interpreted by Barclay, embodied this influence.
In all the history of the place response to strong
personality has been immediate and general. The past is a
history of names. William Russell led the community in
erecting a Meeting House, and then a second one&mdash;which still
stands. Ferriss, the early settler, located the meeting house on
his land, as later Osborn located the Orthodox Meeting House,
at the Division, on his land. Judge Daniel Akin, in the early
Nineteenth Century, was a leader of the economic activities
of this Quaker community, then differentiating themselves
from the religious. So, too, his nephew, Albert Akin, in the last
half of that century was a leader, gathering up the money of
the wealthy farmers to invest in railroads, founding the Pawling
Bank, the Mizzen-Top Hotel, and launching Akin Hall,
with its literary and religious basis.</p>

<p>David Irish, the preacher of the Hicksite Meeting in the
middle of the nineteenth century was leader and exponent
of the most representative phases of Quakerism, for at that
time it was still possible for the business and the religion of
Quakerism to be united in the minds of the majority; Unitarian
Quakerism was the result, and of this David Irish was
the ideal embodiment.</p>

<p>The respect paid by the community to leadership is shown in
the place assigned to Admiral John L. Worden, commander of
the "Monitor," who married a Quaker Hill woman, Olive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Toffey, spent the summers of his life on the Hill, and is
buried in the Pawling Cemetery. There was universal pride
in his charming personality, interest in his sayings, and no
pious condemnation of his warlike deeds. His nautical names
of the high points on the Hill have been generally accepted;
so that the Hill rides high above all surrounding lands, her
heights labelled like the masts of a gallant ship: "Mizzen-Top,"
"Main-Top," "Tip-Top."</p>

<p>There is indeed by contrast a corresponding unwillingness
to be impressed by great personality. The residence of Washington
with his troops in the neighborhood left no impression
on the records of the Meeting, though he turned out the worshippers
and filled the place with sick soldiers; no impression
upon the devout tradition, except the story of his being seen
once in the woods alone on his knees in prayer; and no impression
upon the social tradition, except the cherished claim of
one family that he used their residence as his headquarters.
Washington was the embodiment of all that this community opposed,
and he was ignored.</p>

<p>Another instance of grudging allegiance was the following
given to a New York broker, who set out to build a modern
schoolhouse, and was permitted only by a packed school-meeting,
and by paying two-thirds of the expense himself, to
build in 1892 the comely structure at 43, with which Quaker
Hill is content.</p>

<p>The same resident was discouraged from further acts of
public service, in 1894, by the declining of his offer made to
the town of Pawling, to build one mile of macadam for every
mile built by the town. He had constructed in 1893, at 113, a
sample piece of such road, covering at his own expense an
ancient sink-hole in the highway, through which during two
months in every year for a century and a half Quaker Hill
had wallowed; and he desired with this object-lesson to convince
the town,&mdash;to win the support of at least his neighbors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&mdash;to
the proposal to transform the highways into good roads.
But there was never a response, and even his neighbors on
the Hill, who cheerfully enjoy his smooth stretch of stone
road over the ancient wallow of their fathers, manifested no
active appreciation of his generosity. The generous resident
had purchased a stone-crusher and other necessaries for the
work; but they have been used only on private grounds.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous instance of following leadership in
recent times has been the measured devotion given by the
community to the activities which have centered in Akin Hall
and in the institution known as Hill Hope, on Site 35. The
leaders in this activity have been themselves under the influence
of New York city ideas. Two of the three most conspicuous
persons are of this neighborhood, but have resided
in New York for years, returning to the Hill for the summers.
The third is a New Yorker by birth, and trained in Presbyterian
religious experience and especially in charitable activity.</p>

<p>Akin Hall has in the years 1892-1905 expressed the leadership
in religious confession and worship, after the forms of
the Reformed Christian order, and has embodied this leadership
in the conventional activities of a vigorous country parish.</p>

<p>For ten years Hill Hope, supported personally by the third
member of this group of leaders, was, until it was closed
in 1904, a country home for working girls. By a liberal policy
it became also a center of much interest and of a pervasive
influence to the neighborhood. Meetings of a social and devotional
character were held there, to which the residents were
pleased to come, and in which the young women from the city
met and mingled with the Protestant residents of the Hill,
especially with those of the Quaker stock. The influence of
Hill Hope was very marked, and its power in representing to
people of a narrow experience the ideals of a richer and
broader life was obvious to any one who saw the place it
held in the interests of the whole resident community.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>These influences, thus compounded of the humanitarian,
the liberal-orthodox and the devotional, but in all things confessedly
religious, exerted themselves for the ten years named,
unbroken. The death of one member of this group of leaders,
the head of one of the three households peculiarly identified
with its work, appreciably weakened the group. But in
the thirteen years of its influence, it united the whole community
in the formation of a church, to some of whose services
came all the Protestant population; in whose membership
were representatives of all groups of the Protestant residents;
and which was able at least once a year to call the Catholics also
together at Christmas festivities.</p>

<p>To this group of leaders a guarded, though at times cordial
following was given by Orthodox Friends, the Hicksite
group, the farmer class, laborers, Catholics and Protestants,
and summer people. It was generally inert and negative in
spirit, seldom actively loyal. At its best it was willing that
leaders should lead and pay the price, and be more admired
than upheld. At its worst it was alert to private and blind
to public interests, peevish of change, incapable of foresight.</p>

<p>I do not think that Quaker Hill people have much expectation
of benefit from social life. They are habitually skeptical
of its advantages, though eager to avail themselves of those
advantages when proven. Almost every person on the Hill,
however, is a member of some secret society, to which he is
drawn by anticipations of economic advantage, or of moral
culture.</p>

<p>Nor can I say that there is prompt or general reaction
to wrongdoing, either of one or of many. I might illustrate
with two cases. In one a rich man perverted a public trust,
openly, to his own advantage; and a conspiracy of silence
hedged his wrong about. In the other, a youth entered in one
winter every house on the Hill in succession, and there was
no one to detect or to punish him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hill does not exhibit the highest type of social response
in the recognition of impersonal evil, in the quest of knowledge,
or in free discussion. Almost two centuries of dogma-worship,
with its contemplation of selected facts, has made it
now impossible to secure from one thoroughly socialized in
the spirit of the place the exact truth upon any matter. It
seems to be reserve which conceals it, but it is rather the
effect of continued perversion of the sense of right and wrong,
and indifference to knowledge for its own sake.</p>

<p>The ideal of the common mind of Quaker Hill is the practice
of inner and immaterial religion. It looks for the
effects of certain dogmas, effects expressed in emotions, convictions,
experiences. The ideal contains no thought of the
community or of its welfare. It is purely individual, internal
and emotional.</p>

<p>It was expressed in the comment of one excellent representative
citizen upon another, "He does not seem to me to
be the man he once was. He does not say in meetings the
things he used to say. He used to be very helpful in his
remarks." This was said at a time when the citizen commented
on was laboring heroically for a public improvement
by which the citizen speaking would chiefly be benefited.</p>

<p>The Quaker Hill man and woman desire to make money.
They instinctively love money, though not for any other
purpose than saving. They cherish no illusions of an unworldly
sort about it. This is true of Quaker and Catholic,
laborer and summer resident. It is true of the small class
of cultivated intellectual-aesthetes, who might be expected to
be less mercenary. They all value money; but not for display,
not for luxury, scarcely for travel; not for books or the
education of children. Quaker Hill men and women would
accumulate money, invest and manage it wisely and live in
respectable "plainness." This characteristic is written largely
over the whole social area. It is an instinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The emotional nature of this population has been by long-continued
application of an accepted discipline, economic and
religious, restrained and schooled. More beautiful personalities
than some of the Quaker and Irish women of the Hill,
schooled in a discipline which produces the most charming
manners, the gentlest kindness, one may never see. There is
no cloud in the sky of these women's justice, truthfulness,
goodness. One may remember, even with them, a day of
anger, of indignation; but it was a storm restrained; the
lightnings were held in sure hands, and the attack was eminently
just.</p>

<p>But this very discipline has resulted, in other persons, in
an explosive emotionality. One person suffers this explosion
in a periodic lawsuit&mdash;a rare action for the Hill; another in
an almost insane family quarrel, another in an occasional
fury of futile violence, another in periods, increasing in frequency
as he grows older, of causeless and uncontrolled anger,
or extravagant grief; and when weightier occasion is lacking,
in torrents of language poured forth from the treasuries of
an exhaustless memory. The very serenity and placidity which
Quaker worship and industry produce in the true Quaker
have resulted in the emotional ruin of some, and in the subconscious
volcanic state in others.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the immigrants, Irish and American, have
in this conformed to the better type; so that gentle manners,
placidity of character and restraint of emotion may be said to
prevail among them.</p>

<p>As for judgment, on economic questions and matters of
benevolence the judgment of Quaker Hill people is sound.
They use money sanely and with wisdom. They act wisely
in matters of poverty and need, or appeal on behalf of the dependent.
On other matters, outside the range of the social
discipline in which the community has been to school, not so
much can be said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The judgment of the community is not determined by evidence
in any other matters than economic. The Quaker Hill
mind works subjectively on the lines of instincts and habits
inherited and inbred. Auto-suggestion has been a great force
in this community. Men and women have had an impression,
"a leading," believed to come from the Divine Spirit, and have
acted upon it and have led others with them. So that the
prevailing determination of the social judgment has been
by personal suggestion, and the appeal of inner convictions,
fortified by alleged divine influence. It must be said that this
is a disappearing habit. Even those born Quakers, now that
the Hicksite Meeting has been discontinued since 1885, and
the Orthodox since 1903, and the Quarterly Meetings of both
societies have ceased to come to the Hill, do not so often see
visions or act upon "leadings." The influence of non-Quakers
in the place has been of late to quarantine such "leadings" and
prevent social contagion.</p>

<p>Frugality is universal. Almost every resident laboring
man has a bank account. Indeed, these laborers have done
more in saving than have the farmers. But the tastes of all
are simple. Clothing is never showy or expensive, and housekeeping
is carried on with the most sparing use of purchased
articles.</p>

<p>Cleanly most of the people of the Hill are, in person and
in their care of house and grounds, of carriages, horses
and other properties. The houses and barns are always
freshly painted, and an appearance of neatness pervades the
community.</p>

<p>For reasons which I will mention in a later paragraph the
men and women trained under Quakerism are not orderly,
either in the use of their time or in the management of their
labor, or in anything, save in the discipline of their religion
and in the economic system to which they give themselves.</p>

<p>The community has grown in compassion since the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
when Surgeon Fallon's soldiers were starved and neglected
in the Meeting House. To-day I am sure no class of men in
real need could appeal to the community, or to any constituent
group of it, in vain. The growth has been along lines which,
beginning in a group-compassion that has from earliest days
recompensed any poor member of the Meeting in his sudden
losses of property, have widened first to Quakers of other
places, then to other Christians, then to other men, and last of
all to Quakers of the other Quaker sect; and from Protestant
to Catholic and Catholic to Protestant.</p>

<p>Property seems to be sacred. Doors of houses and barns
do not require locks, but one winter there was a series of
house-breakings, in which almost every summer residence on
the Hill was entered. Contents were inspected, but nothing
was stolen. But the honesty here is a passive honesty. It is
not the aggressively just fulfilment of obligation which one
finds in New England.</p>

<p>The Hill is a community with a high level of chastity.
This may be said of all classes, though not uniformly of all.
Yet it was not always so. The first century of the life of the
Quakers here is recorded in the minutes of Oblong Meeting
as one long struggle of Quaker discipline against unchastity.
There is an amazing frankness about these records, and a persistence
in the exercise of discipline, a frequency of accusation,
proof, conviction, expulsion from the Meeting, which is astonishing
to the twentieth century reader. The best families furnished
the culprits almost as often as they supplied the accusers
and prosecuting committees. So many are the cases and so
frequent the expulsions, often for matters which might better
have been ignored, but generally for substantial offences, that
one wonders who was left in the Meeting. But men often
confessed and were received again, and the Meeting held its
ground. In general it may be said that often in the eighteenth
century there were more cases of unchastity dealt with in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
year by the Meeting, in a population no larger than the present,
than have come to public knowledge in the past ten years
in this community. The change shows also in a reserve of
speech upon these matters.</p>

<p>The characteristic pleasures of the community, as a whole,
are few. There is a group of women of leisure, of course,
devoted to bridge-whist, who come in the summer and do not
go far from the Hotel. Young men go hunting, and a few
grown men are fond of fishing. The typical person provides
himself with no pleasures outside of his family and home.
Men and women are too busy to play, and the Quakers educated
themselves out of a playful mind.</p>

<p>There are a few pleasures which are native and general.
One of these is public assembly, with an entertaining speaker
as a central pleasure. Quaker Hill audiences are alert and
keen hearers, and indulgent critics of a public speaker. There
are only two other forms of public entertainment more pleasing
to them. The first is a dramatic presentation. Many of
the Quakers are excellent actors, and the Irish are quite their
equals, while the other newcomers are equally appreciative.
The Christmas play in Akin Hall is a great annual event, assembling
all the people on the Hill of all classes and groups,
for it embodies very many of the appeals to characteristic
pleasure. Only one other attraction is more generally responded
to; I refer to a dinner. Something good to eat, in
common with one's neighbors, in a place hallowed by historic
associations, under religious auspices&mdash;here you have the call
that brings Quaker Hill all together. On such a day there
will be none left behind.</p>

<p>Of all these sorts is the attraction the Quaker Hill Conference
has for the people of the neighborhood. It is a universal
appeal to the capacity for pleasure in the community. It presents
famous and eloquent speakers through the days of the
week. Matters of religion, farming, morals, literature, are
discussed, by men of taste and culture; and the closing day is
Quaker Hill Day. On this day, after an assembly in the old
Oblong Meeting House, erected in 1764, at which the neighborhood
has listened to papers descriptive of the past of the
Hill, all adjourn for a generous dinner under the trees of Akin
Hall, or latterly under a tent beside the Meeting House,
partaken of by four hundred people, of all groups and
classes, and followed by brisk, happy speeches by visitors
present. This, after almost two centuries of keen interest in
the question of amusements, is the last and most perfect expression
of the capacity for amusement in the community.</p>

<p>Of active pleasure-taking, Quaker Hill, purely considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is incapable.</p>

<p>It should be said that the Roman Catholic Church in Pawling
provides its people with a yearly feast, parallel with the
Conference, which was for years held in a grove on the borders
of Quaker Hill.</p>

<p>Traits of character which are general or even common
among Quaker Hill people are worthy of mention under the
heads of regular industry, frugality, cleanliness, temperance,
chastity, honesty as to property, and compassion.</p>

<p>Politically the Hill was until the year 1896 inclined to be
Democratic. For years a number of the Protestants on the
Hill have been Prohibitionists.</p>

<p>Primitive notions of morals survive in spite of what has
been said earlier, in isolated instances, or tend to recur in
certain families. Until twelve years ago members of certain
families maintained the right to catch fish with a net in
Hammersley Lake. Over the line in Connecticut this practice,
and that of taking fish with a spear, survive in spite of
law. But this primitive method was forcibly ended by the
attempt to arrest the chief offender. He made his escape
from the officers, but has never returned, and the practice has
not till this date, 1905, been resumed on Quaker Hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Primitive moralities of sex appear in certain families,
in which in each generation there appears one illegitimate
child, at least; as it were a reminder of their disorderly past.
The chari-vari survives among the better class of working
people, a strange, noisy outbreak for a Quaker community,
with which a newly married pair are usually serenaded.</p>

<p>I find also no animistic ideas, or practices; no folk-lore
and no magic. The Quaker Hill imagination has been
disciplined.</p>

<p>The preferred attainment in this community is neither
power, splendor, pleasure, nor ceremonial purity; nor yet justice,
liberty or enlightenment; but rather, first of all, prosperity,
a well-being in which one's good fortune sheds its
favors on others; secondly, righteousness, to be enjoyed in
religious complacency; and thirdly, equality. This last is one
of the few elements of a social ideal actually realized. Even
among the women of the place there is a simple and unaffected
democracy in the religious and communal societies, which is
quite unusual in such a place.</p>

<p>Of sacred places there are avowedly none. But the historic
sense of the community is reverent, almost religious, in
its regard for the past; so that the Oblong Meeting House,
cradle of the community, and for over a century its home and
house of government, is chief in the affections of all. In the
summer of 1904 this place was marked for all time by the
placing there of a boulder of white feldspar, bearing a bronze
tablet inscribed with the important facts of the history of
that spot.</p>

<p>Quaker Hill does not desire to expand. The type of community
preferred is the simple, small, and exclusive. In this
all agree, whether they confess it or not. No expansion will
ever come by native forces or conscious purpose.</p>

<p>Quaker Hill reveres leaders, not heroes; and not saints,
for men have been cherished for their leadership in dogmatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
activities, rather than for their abstract goodness or human
value. The type of the social mind that has been most esteemed
is the dogmatic-emotional. Even Albert J. Akin,
whose dogma was the union of all Christians, had no patience
with any divergence in religious experience from this, his
dogma.</p>

<p>The forms of complex activity that are chiefly cherished
are, first, the economic arts; second, religion; third, morals;
and fourth, things pertaining to costume. The institutions
chiefly prized are the family and marriage, the economic system
and the cultural system, especially the church.</p>

<p>Social welfare is conceived of under forms of peace, the
increase and diffusion of wealth, industry, and by a minority,
culture. High morality is most valued as an element in the
social personality. Next after it is a highly developed sociality.
Social policies would be favored on the Hill as they represented
authority and individualism. Conversion is the accepted means
of modifying type.</p>

<p>Practical politics may be said to be foreign to Quaker Hill,
for reasons drawn from its isolation and religious offishness.
An exception was in the early part of the nineteenth century,
when Daniel Akin, apparently in consequence of mercantile
position, was elected County Judge. After him, his brother
Albro was appointed to the office.</p>

<p>The consciousness of kind on Quaker Hill is stronger in
the group than in the community. Yet the general sense of
"unity" is very strong and it often comes into play.</p>

<p>The chief social bonds which unite the whole community
are, first of all, imitation, in which process it seems to me the
Quakers are a peculiarly subtle people. Second, a good-will
which pervades the Hill like a genial atmosphere. Third,
kindness, which on certain occasions draws the whole community
together in unusual acts of helpfulness to some member
in need.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VC" id="CHAPTER_VC"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES AND RESEMBLANCES.</h3>


<p>The prevailing type of mind among Quaker Hill folk is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the Ideo-Emotional; for these folk are a gentle, social sort of
persons, ready of affection, imaginative and analogical in mental
process, weak and complacent in emotionality, with motor
reaction rather inconstant, and of slow response. Of these I
find thirty-seven families.</p>

<p>The next category is that of the Dogmatic-Emotional,
in which I observe twenty-two families. These are composed
of persons in whom austere and domineering character proceeds
from a dogmatic fixity of mind, and expresses itself in
the same inconstant application shown by the former class.</p>

<p>A few of the more notable of the personalities produced by
Quaker birth and breeding belong, I think, in the Ideo-Motor
class. I find only seven families of that type, but the forceful
character, of aggressive bent, moderate intellect and strong but
well-controlled emotion, is distinctly present; and this class has
furnished some of the most successful of the sons of Quaker
Hill.</p>

<p>I have known only six persons resident on the Hill in the
twelve years under study who could be described as Critically-Intellectual.
Of these, four have been bred in the larger
school of the city, and only two have lived their lives upon
the Hill. Of these six, five are women.</p>

<p>There is, of course, only one language spoken in Quaker
Hill. Indeed only one or two persons have any other than English
as their native tongue.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And very few have acquired any
other as a matter of culture. The vocabulary used is limited.
An intelligent observer says: "The vocabulary of the native
community is the meagerest I have ever known, except that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>the immigrant." There are, however, very few illiterates;
none, indeed, in the literal meaning of the term.</p>

<p>Manners on the whole are uniform for the resident population.
Of course the summer people have the conventional
manners, or lack of manners, of the city. So far as religion
has shaped the manners of the old Quaker group, they are
often gentle and refined; but as often blunt and imperious.
The Irish have the best manners, I observe, and the more
transient summer people and farm-hands the worst. In both
the last two classes there is too often a pride in rudeness and
vulgarity which the native of mature years never exhibits.
The Quaker and the Catholic are equally ceremonious in inclination.
The latter always desires to please. The Quaker,
when he desires to please, is capable of very fine courtesy;
but he does not always desire, and he has less insight into the
essence of a social situation.</p>

<p>The community has had a history, of course, in the matter
of costume. The Meeting House law made costume a matter
of ethics for a century. But to-day there is great diversity.
Probably this is a sign of the transition from the Quaker to the
broader human order. But all one can say upon costume is
that there is now no dress prescribed for any occasion. At
one extreme there are a few, in 1905 only three, in 1907 only
one, who wear the Quaker garb. At the other extreme are
outsiders who dress as the city tailor and milliner clothe them.
And between these there is liberty.</p>

<p>The dispositions again are varied. One finds the aggressiveness
of five stirring men and three capable women sufficient
to give character to the place. Many functions of the
community are still vigorously upheld, yet the number of aggressive
spirits is diminishing. The instigative type is present
in three, and its processes give pleasure to all who behold.
The domineering type is present in eight members, especially
in those families which claim by right of inheritance either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
social or religious leadership. And, as to others, as I quoted
an observer above, "They are an obedient people." I do not
know any creative minds, much less any class with original
initiative. If there had been any such, Quaker Hill would have
produced artists, great and small, and writers, not a few.
There is a consciousness of material for creation, and in certain
families the culture which creation presupposes; but something
in Quakerism has quieted the muse and banked the fires.</p>

<p>As to types of character, there are forceful persons, a very
few, nine at the utmost being of this type. Austere persons,
who have in the past given to the Hill much of its character,
have almost disappeared, not more than four being within
that category, among the population under study in this part
of the book.</p>

<p>The number of the rationally conscientious is as small as is
that of the convivial. The Meeting, which was for over a
century the organ of conscience for the community, denied to
the convivial their license, and released the conscientious from
any obligation to be rational. The Meeting has now but recently
passed away, and its standards of character speak as
loudly as ever. I find three women who may be called rationally
conscientious, one a Quakeress, one a New Yorker, and
one of Quaker birth and worldly breeding. I find also three
who are truly convivial in type, one a son of Quakers, and
two who are Irish Catholics; while to these might be added
two whose designation ought to be Industrious-Convivial,
hard-working men who are fond of social pleasure as an end
of life.</p>

<p>A few in certain households, three in number, are intellectually
aesthetic in a passive way, fond of art and books, but
creating nothing. Two artists of note have in the past twelve
years come to the Hill, bought places and made it at least a
summer home.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from the foregoing that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
not a wide range of mental difference among Quaker Hill
men and women. In the matter of quickness and slowness
of action this variation appears even among the members of
any one group. In the same family are two brothers, both
farmers, both tenants. One is able to farm a thousand acres
more successfully than the other can cultivate two hundred.
The one is instant in judgment, swift in action, able to compress
into an hour heavy physical labor and also the control
of many other men. The other is leisurely, indolent in movement,
though a diligent man, and is as much burdened by
increase of responsibilities as the former is stimulated. These
two men are not exceptional, but typical. The extreme of
slowness is indeed represented in one man whose tortoise pace
in all matters dependent on the mind and will is oddly contrasted
with his vigor and energy of manner. His movements
are a provocation of delighted comments by his neighbors;
I think partly because they are felt to be representative of
what is latent in other men, and partly because he is surrounded
by others more alert. Such men are the outcropping
of a vein of degenerate will. It is not immoral degeneracy,
but its weakness is incapacity for action of any kind,
inability to see and do the specific task. This degenerate will
does not extend to traditional morals, and does not always
affect whole families. But its pervasive effects are seen in
almost all the representatives of three large families of the
old Quaker stock. Contrasted to these are some of the old
stock, who though slow of thought and barren of mental
initiative, are swift of action, sure in synthesis of a situation,
and instant in performance of precisely the requisite deed.</p>

<p>One finds on the Hill many examples of native administrative
ability of a high order&mdash;for a farm is as complicated a
property as a railway is. There are fully as many others who
would be burdened with the cares of a ticket-chopper.</p>

<p>Not a few on the Hill are like the farmer who, sent on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
errand to bring some guests from a train to a certain house,
spent half an hour after meeting the guests in conversation
with them in the railway station before mentioning his errand;
and would have made it an hour had they not inquired of him
for a conveyance. Yet a neighbor of his, in the same social
group, closely related, has unusual capacity for affairs.</p>

<p>The instincts of the people of the Hill are not, I think,
so varied. They involuntarily respect religion, when expressed
with sincerity, and incarnated in strength of character.
It must have the authority, however, of strength, at least
passive strength, to appeal to local instinct.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="CHAPTER_VIC" id="CHAPTER_VIC"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION.</h3>


<p>The members of the community have organized themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
into associations for the carrying on of special forms of activity
to a degree which is worthy of record. As one might expect,
the societies of most vigor are those maintained by the women,
since the men have never been able spontaneously to organize,
or to maintain, any society on the Hill.</p>

<p>Central to all this organization, through the period of the
Mixed Community, has been Akin Hall Association, created
by one man, and endowed by him. Under its shelter a church
and library live, and a yearly Conference is maintained for
five days in the month of September. In this chapter we
will consider first the incorporated, then the unincorporated
societies.</p>

<p>The chief incorporated institution on Quaker Hill is Akin
Hall Association, founded in 1880 by Albert J. Akin. It was
his intention to create an institution of the broadest purpose,
through which could be carried on activities of a religious,
literary, educational, benevolent and generally helpful order.
"Albert Akin endowed," said a visitor, "not a college or a
hospital, but a community!" The charter of the Association,
which was from time to time, on advice, amended, up to the
time of Mr. Akin's death in 1903, provided for the most
catholic endowment of Quaker Hill, in every possible need of
its population.</p>

<p>The particular directions in which this endowment has been
used are two. A library and a church are in active use by the
neighborhood, the former since 1883, and the latter since 1895,
of which I will speak in detail hereafter.</p>

<p>Akin Hall Association is a corporation consisting of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
trustees, a self-perpetuating body, and eleven other "members."
The number of trustees was originally sixteen, but Mr. Akin
early yielded to legal advice in concentrating authority in five
persons; while continuing the remaining eleven as a quasi-public
to whom the five report their doings, and with whom
they regularly confer. The annual meeting of the Association
is upon the birthday of the founder, August 14th. At that
time the trustees assemble at two p. m. for the transaction of
business, election of members and of officers; and at 3 p. m.
the members' meeting is called to order, the officers of the
trustees being officers of the whole body. Members are permitted
and expected to inquire as to activities of the Association,
its funds and its work in general, and to vote on all matters
coming before the body for its action. Only no action involving
the expenditure of money, or the election of trustees,
shall be valid without the concurrence in majority opinion of
a majority of the trustees.</p>

<p>The chief interest of the trustees has always been the care
of the property of the Association, which includes invested
funds, and the following buildings, with about thirty acres of
land: a hotel, having rooms for two hundred guests, a stone
library, a chapel, and seven cottages. The hotel is usually
rented to a "proprietor," and the duties of the library and
church are laid upon a minister, the earliest of whom, Mr.
Chas. Ryder, was called the "Agent."</p>

<p>The Akin Free Library, consisting of about three thousand
books, selected with uncommon wisdom by committees of ladies
through about twenty-five years, was originally established
by the ladies of the Hill, in the early eighties, through a popular
fund. It has ever since been funded by the Akin Hall Association,
who have also given it quarters, and care, in the Chapel
known as Akin Hall. It will soon be moved into the stone
Library, erected in 1898, but only finished in 1906, and it is
reasonable to suppose that it will there have a wider scope
and an increasing use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The Library has been managed primarily for the use of
"the Summer people," and the books have the excellence of
their selection, as well as the proportion of certain kinds of
books, determined by the preferences of the Summer residents.
No adequate records are kept of the books used; so that it is
impossible to give statistics of the specific utility of the library.
But it occupies a real place in the community, and is drawn
upon by families from every section of the population.</p>

<p>The fact that it was originally assembled by popular subscription,
and only later sustained by the Akin endowment is
a token of the exceptional latent interest in literature, and the
passive culture, to which tribute has been paid in this study
of the Quaker Hill population. It is fair to say, however, that
such interest has been confined to a small group of the population,
now fast disappearing.</p>

<p>There is a small corporation, formed for the purpose of
holding and caring for the "Old Meeting House." It is known
as Oblong Meeting House, Incorporated. To this corporation,
consisting of three trustees, a self-perpetuating body, the
Yearly Meeting of Friends<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> handed over in 1902 the building
and grounds known as the "Old Meeting House," at Site 28.
This ancient building, erected in 1764, is probably the oldest
edifice on the Hill, and is the embodiment of the religious and
historical traditions of the community. These trustees attend
to the repair of the Meeting House, which is maintained in
exactly the condition in which it was used for over a century.
No meeting of worship is held now in this building, the
"monthly meeting" having been "laid down" in 1885. The
building is, however, the center of frequent pilgrimages during
the summer, by the visitors to the Hill and boarders, who
delight in its quaint interior. It is used for occasional "sales"
for the "benefit" of some public interest. Once a year at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>close of Quaker Hill Conference, it is the place of "Quaker Hill
Day" exercises, at which addresses and papers are presented, in
celebration and commemoration of the past history of the
community.</p>

<p>The Hill has record of few revivals. Quaker ways preclude
surprises, and revivals usually arise from new things.
There was, however, during five years, 1892-1897, a religious
awakening, prolonged month after month, for five years with
undiminished force. The cause of it seems to have been the
study of the Bible in the historic method; a new mode of
awakening traditional religious interest. During that time the
whole community was keenly alive, old and young; and in
certain cases a change of life became permanent. In many
young persons a definite religious impulse was the result.</p>

<p>This quickened religious interest involved all the Quaker
influence, both Orthodox and Hicksite, and it was reinforced
by several strong personalities from outside the Hill, persons
trained in church work in New York and elsewhere. It crystallized
in the organization of "Christ's Church, Quaker Hill,"
in the Spring of 1895, which received at the beginning adherents
of all the religious groups represented on the Hill.
Within three years it had grown to a membership of sixty-five,
among whom were members or adherents of the following
religious bodies, Protestant Episcopal Church, Anglican
and Roman Catholic Churches, Quakers, Hicksite and Orthodox,
Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist Episcopal, Congregational,
Disciples and Lutheran.</p>

<p>This church is served by the minister employed in Akin
Hall, and it has therefore a peculiar place. Its membership
is drawn from the population resident on the Hill. Its doctrinal
truths are simple, namely the Apostles' Creed. Its
ordinances are elastic, baptism being waived in the case of
those who, being trained as Quakers, do not believe in water
baptism; and by the conditions affixed to Mr. Akin's endow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>ment,
that no denominational use should ever be made of Akin
Hall, it is without sectarian connections.</p>

<p>The religious services in Akin Hall have in Summer been
attended since 1880 by numbers of "summer people," from
Mizzen-Top Hotel and the boarding-houses. A Sunday School
was maintained from 1890 to 1905, a Christian Endeavor Society
from 1894 to 1903. Both have been discontinued, owing
to lack of members.</p>

<p>The church has also a diminished membership, especially
since 1903, owing in part to mere removal of population; and
even more to the death and removal from the Hill of persons
of forceful, aggressive type, and the impoverishment of the
population in respect of initiative and coherence.</p>

<p>The other agency carried on under the patronage of Akin
Hall Association is the Quaker Hill Conference. Founded in
1899 by Mr. Akin, entertained by Miss Monahan, this assembly
has made September of each year a focal point in local interest.
For five days of public meetings, Bible study, addresses upon
religion, social and economic topics, culminating in a great
dinner, of which four hundred partake, it is the modern successor
of the now extinct Quaker Quarterly meetings. It expended
in 1907 about $1,400, of which about half was contributed
by Akin Hall Association, and the remainder by
individuals.</p>

<p>The groups in which the women of the Hill are associated
are of great interest. The Roman Catholic women have only
their kinship associations, and no voluntary associations, being
generally in the employ of Protestants, and having their church
center away from the Hill in Pawling village.</p>

<p>The King's Daughters is the largest association, and most
representative of the Hill, both in its numbers, frequency of
meetings and variety of interests; though it is not the oldest.
It has a membership of forty, and is actively devotional, charitable
and benevolent. It serves also a useful purpose in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>viding
social meetings, bazaars, sales and other occasions
throughout the year which bring neighbors together; and uses
their assembling for the assisting of the poor, ignorant or
needy.</p>

<p>This society, as well as the one to be mentioned next, exemplifies
the real democracy in which the women of the Hill
meet and plan for common local interests; a fine spirit and
practical efficiency characterizing their meetings, and each
woman, however, humble, having a part with the best in the
general result.</p>

<p>The Wayside Path Association is smaller in number of
members, as well as older than the King's Daughters; indeed,
it has perhaps no fixed membership, but is an assembling of
the women of the place about a small group as a working
center for a yearly duty. Its purpose is to maintain a dirt
sidewalk, over three miles in length, which follows the road
northward and southward, from the Glen to the Post Office,
with branches. Once a year the Association meets, gathers
funds by a "sale" or by subscription, hires a laborer to repair
the Wayside Path; then for a year lies dormant. In 1898 there
was a general effort made to transform this association into
a general Village Improvement Society, with diversified interests,
into which men would come, but it failed, and no such
society exists.</p>

<p>The West Mountain Mission is an association of ladies of
the Hill, who through sales and bazaars, supplemented by
gifts, contribute to the support of a chapel of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, two miles west of Pawling. This association
draws its membership from the hotel guests and from
residents in the cottages; and but little from the essential
Quaker Hill households.</p>

<p>The same may be said of whist clubs maintained in the
summer at the hotel and cottages.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">THE SOCIAL WELFARE.</h3>


<p>Quaker Hill is an example of the working of a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and economic system toward its inevitable results in social
welfare. The results consciously sought were mainly personal.
They were not seeking culture or security or equity, and not
attempting to create a community, those early Quakers; but
they sought with all their heart and mind after prosperity,
individual and communal; after vitality, morality and that
self-expression which is in the form of self-sacrifice or altruism
in "the service of others." The conscious mind of the
Quaker fathers of this community was other-worldly, except
in the matters of business&mdash;of which more later. That "spiritual"
state of mind was intensely individual. All the interests
it regarded were of the self, conceived as an inner, immaterial
duplicate of the body, destined for heaven after death, and
now enjoying interchanges of experience, especially of emotion
and intelligence, with the Deity, during life.</p>

<p>It was a mind consciously framed to serve personal development,
with no thought of public or common interests. Yet
subconsciously the Quaker was acutely aware of common interests.
A Quaker frequently uses the expression "I feel
myself in unity with them." Their doctrine of the indwelling
of the divine in every man made them quick to feel common
emotion. Their group-sympathy was lively and strong. They
felt the community, though they never thought upon it. Subconsciously,
though not consciously, they were public-spirited.
They acted upon a fine social spirit, thought they taught no
social gospel.</p>

<p>"The supreme result of efficient organization,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> says Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>fessor
F. H. Giddings, "and the supreme test of efficiency is
the development of the personality of the social man. If the
man himself becomes less social, less rational, less manly; if
he falls from the highest type, which seeks self-realization
through a critical intelligence and emotional control, to one
of those lower types which manifest only the primitive virtues
of power; if he becomes unsocial, the social organization, whatever
its apparent merits, is failing to achieve its supreme object.
If, on the contrary, the man is becoming ever better as
a human being, more rational, more sympathetic, with an ever
broadening consciousness of kind, then, whatever its apparent
defects, the social organization is sound and efficient." Let
us consider whether Quaker Hill has met this test. It has
been well organized. It has had definite purposes. What has
been the type of welfare enjoyed as a result? What kind of
man has emerged from almost two centuries of cultivation of
a religious and economic ideal?</p>

<p>In economic operations the Quakers dwelt in this world.
They sought a living and they sought wealth&mdash;not for the services
wealth can render in culture and education, but to
accumulate it, possess it, invest and manage it, and to live "in
plainness."</p>

<p>Yet they subconsciously did also seek after a prosperity
that should be general. Not closely, not in any declarations
or definite teachings of their code, but still in a real way, as
a by-product of their code of life, they acted so that none in
their community should be in want. This they did with profound
wisdom&mdash;for they taught no communal doctrine&mdash;and
the details of their action toward weaker members of the
neighborhood were uncommonly shrewd and sensible. I will
show later the effects of this in the fact that the population
under our study shows the absence of defective classes in a
significant degree. There are no idiots, no defective, no criminal,
no pauper classes among the Quaker Hill population.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The mind of the community had, indeed, an active interest
in liberty and the contribution noted above (see Ch. IV. Part I)
in the agitation for the abolition of slavery in this state was
an act of public spirit along the lines of a great national experience.
The fact that the meeting of Friends in 1767 was held
on Quaker Hill, which initiated effective action against slave-holding,
is much cherished on the Hill, and is commemorated
in a stone and bronze memorial at the Meeting House.</p>

<p>Equality of suffrage and universal suffrage are jealously
believed in, owing to the Quaker teaching as to woman's
parity with man. Yet in the school-meeting, in which women
have the same right to vote that men have, there are seldom
any women present. Indeed, except for a packed meeting once
in a decade, to decide some agitated question, few women attend
school-meetings.</p>

<p>The size of the holdings of land on the Hill, and the curve
of increase and decrease for seventy years, are exhibited in
Table II.</p>

</table></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The above table gives in a graphic manner the tendency
of wealth to increase, on the Hill, so far as wealth is represented
in land. It is to be noted that these figures, taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Tax-Lists of the town of Pawling, are not precisely accurate,
especially in the lower ranges. There is an evident inaccuracy
in the reporting of the smaller places. Yet from them
the following may be inferred: First, that from the beginning
of the reports, which was about the end of the period of the
Quaker Community, there was a shrinkage in the size of the
land-holdings on the Hill; and from the beginning of the
period of the Mixed Community a rise in the general averages.
The lowest of the curve is about 1890, in the Median, the average
and in each of the quartiles. Second, the incoming of the
Irish immigrants, who began to be land-holders about 1850,
multiplied the number of small holdings of land.</p>

<p>Just what cause has operated in the years 1890-1906 to
increase the size of the holdings of land it is hard to say, unless
it be the expectation that land would have a value, which is
aroused by the presence on the Hill every summer of visitors
to a number equal to the numbers of the resident population.
It is evident at the present time, when the "milk business"
has been reduced to half in the past five years, that the farmers
are holding their lands with a hope of selling.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the tax-list of the town furnish
no other data of reliable value, or even of suggestion, being
obviously inaccurate and uneven in their reports of the values
of land, and of the holdings of personal property.</p>

<p>The fact that is not recorded in the above statistics is this:
that certain owners, associated in close family ties, own all the
land of greatest value. Seven family groups possess, in the
names of eleven of the above owners, all the land near the
Hotel, all the land for which any one has ever thought of
charging more than fifty dollars an acre. These eleven owners
of all the land of greatest value possess probably nine-tenths
of the personal property.</p>

<p>Holdings of property on Quaker Hill are very unequal.
The smallest owner of real estate has an acre, and the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
about six hundred acres. Contrasts here are sharp and permanent.
The same families have possessed certain properties
for many decades, often for two centuries; and generally
Quaker Hill families do not sell till they all die or move away.</p>

<p>Wealth is increasing on Quaker Hill in the slow course
of years, and probably along the lines of present growth, will
increase. It is distributed with marked inequality. The tendency,
especially in central territory, is toward increasing
inequality. There is "a small group at a high degree."</p>

<p>Yet the community is generally prosperous and well-to-do.
There are none poor. Indeed, the wealthy women who began
to come to Mizzen-Top Hotel in 1880, looking about for some
poor to assist, were obliged to go off the Hill to the south,
and lay hold of a lonely female with a curious nervous malady
but self-respecting withal, and deliberately pauperize her. To
this process, after some initial struggles, she has submitted
through these intervening years. She has now for years been
pensioned by the church in Akin Hall through the year, visited
in summer by people in carriages, has maintained an extensive
begging correspondence through the mails all winter, and has
been generally despised by her neighbors. But she has represented
to interested clergymen and charity workers on their
summer vacations the fascinating and mysterious problem of
poverty.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Very few indeed have been the defectives. I know of none
in ten years. The prevailing vitality of the community is high.
There were living two years ago five persons past ninety;
and one of them died in his hundredth year. Octogenarians
drive the roads every day, and manage their estates with ripe
discretion and unabated interest in affairs. The religious revival
referred to (see Chapter VI) brought into the church
an active man of great wealth of ninety-five years of age.</p>

<p>There are no blind persons. One old man, who suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
from cataract, lost an eye in an operation at eighty-five years
of age; and refused to submit the other eye-ball to the surgeon.
There are no deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>People on Quaker Hill are well-born. I suppose this may
be in part due to the high morality of their fathers. I attribute
it, in view of the contrast in this respect to the contiguous
population in Sherman, Conn., to the highly organic communal
life of Quaker Hill. Connecticut people, some of them
of the same original Quaker stock, have settled on small holdings
of lands, and held them till isolation and poverty have
driven them to suicide, insanity or other miseries. Quaker
Hill was from the beginning differentiated into a healthier
diversity, and it has been the better for her people.</p>

<p>There are few mentally abnormal persons in the community.
One may designate three persons as unbalanced, two
of them unmarried women; and another such as probably insane,
though residing at home. But even the aged do not die
first in the head. There are no idiotic persons.</p>

<p>The prevailing morality is high. Very few would be
classified as immoral, by the public disapproval of their conduct.
Individuals have committed theft, or an act of cruelty,
or adultery, in the years 1895-1905. They do not constitute
classes.</p>

<p>The sociality of Quaker Hill seems to the writer relatively
high. Response to a case of real need is prompt, wise and
abundant; and common action for others is heartily begun and
completed. There are no unsocialized persons; neither paupers,
criminals, nor degraded, in the community; at least no class
or classes of such. There is a man who perhaps drinks too
much and too often; but even he is too far from the saloon to
attain to the dignity of neighborhood drunkard.</p>

<p>Quaker Hill has not been of a mind to contribute institutions
or resources to the public. Toward war hostile, toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the state always impassive, sometimes actively disloyal in times
of war, Quaker Hill has lived a life apart.</p>

<p>Common school privileges are offered to all in the three
school houses at Sites 12, 43 and 101 (school districts No.
1, 3, 4) and the advantages offered are generally studiously
appropriated by the young. In the ten years under study two
families alone have been unwilling to take full advantage of
the school opportunities.</p>

<p>In the school at Site 43, for which alone an improved,
modern building has been erected, there was, beginning in
1893, a determined effort made to provide a school better than
the ordinary country school. By the co-operation of certain
farmers with children in school, and through contributions of
citizens of means who had no children, better teachers were
employed, at increased expense, for the space of twelve years.
During two years the school was graded, employing two
teachers. But the effort in this direction seems to have ceased
with the close of the year 1905-1906. This school has had,
for the years 1904-6, only one Protestant child, in an enrollment
of twenty to thirty.</p>

<p>The other school-districts are maintained "in the old back-country
way," their attendance is small and no effort is made
to raise the standard of teaching.</p>

<p>It has been accepted for generations among the authoritative
leaders on Quaker Hill that "higher education was not
good for the poor." Of this doctrine, Albert Akin, generally
progressive, was a firm believer. He insisted, and other representatives
of the leading families have done the same, that "to
offer them higher education only makes them discontented";
"they won't work if you get them to studying&mdash;and somebody
must do the work."</p>

<p>It seems in strict harmony with this opinion, which I never
heard opposed on the Hill, that Quaker Hill has never until
1904 sent a young man or woman through the college or university.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Albert J. Akin, 2d, was a member of class of 1904
of Columbia University, but he was not born on the Hill, and
never long resided there. Indeed, the town of Pawling has
not another college graduate among its sons. There have
been, however, a few who have gone to school to the grade
of high school and no normal schools. In the past ten years
ten young men and women have done so. One youth all but
completed a college course in 1906. Two young women are
just completing courses as nurses.</p>

<p>Personality is the field in which the conscious purpose
cherished on Quaker Hill would have wrought its best
efforts. But personality was always on Quaker Hill inhibited,
restrained and schooled into mediocrity. Variation was repressed.
Spontaneity was forbidden. Ingenuous spirits were
firmly and effectively directed into channels believed to be
harmless.</p>

<p>The result has been that mediocre people have both lived
on the Hill, and gone away from it, in voluntary exile from
its beautiful scenes, but not in exile from its spirit of plainness.
No person of brilliant mind or of uncommon talents
has ever come of the Quaker Hill population. There is not
among the sons or daughters of this place one whose name is
of lasting interest to any beyond the limits of Pawling. No
artist or poet has ever ventured to express the intense feeling
of the aesthetic which pervades the place, but has always been
hushed from singing, restrained from picturing.</p>

<p>I think the end for which the Quaker Hill population have
lived could be called Individual-Social. They are consciously
individual, and unconsciously, inevitably social. These people
have sought generation after generation for personal salvation
and personal gain. "And that," says a resident, "that is why
the place is dying." Yet the common interest was a logical
corollary of the Quaker doctrine of God in every man, and
therefore a community was formed, a community indeed
which was no one's conscious care. In the chapter upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
"The Common Mind," above, I have showed that all the
leaders of the community as a whole, save one, have been
outsiders, who came to see the integrity of the community
with eyes of "the world's people," and these leaders in communal
service have been grudgingly followed.</p>

<p>That one, Albert J. Akin, who founded Akin Hall Association,
lived away from Quaker Hill, in New York City, the
most of the months of fifty years, 1830-1880, and fell under
the influence of outsiders.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, a rare beauty characterizes these children of the old
Quaker Community; and a fine harmony blends the members
of the Mixed Community into one another. The type of
country gentleman and lady was perfectly embodied in James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
J. Vanderburgh, who died about 1889, in his residence at Site
30. He was a good man, hospitable, large-minded, well read,
humane; he was sufficiently reverent to be good neighbor to
the Orthodox; and he was sufficiently wealthy to express the
Quaker economic ideal. He had the Quaker genius of thrift
expressing itself in bounty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zayde Akin Bancroft, resident at Site 32, who died
in 1896, was an example of the ideal Quaker Hill lady. A
woman of leisure and culture, accustomed to the possession of
wealth, and enjoying it in books and travel, she surrounded
herself for several of her last years with an atmosphere, and
secured for herself enjoyment, of the highest aspirations of the
Quaker Hill economic ideal.</p>

<p>No one quite so much embodied that ideal as Albert J.
Akin, who died in his hundredth year, in January, 1903. His
fortune, which amounted at his death to more than two million
dollars, was the culmination of the wealth of his family, acquired
since his great-great-grandfather, David Akin, the
pioneer, came to Quaker Hill about 1730. He was a far-seeing
and brilliant investor, and through his long business
life, which lasted until 1901, he followed the growth of railroads
in the United States with steady optimism, and almost
unvarying profit. After the year 1880 he came to live on
Quaker Hill, in the interest of his health, more constantly
than he had in the preceding fifty years. He at once interested
himself in local enterprises, and Akin Hall Association and
Mizzen-Top Hotel were at that time founded by him and
others. Until his death, twenty-three years later, he was the
leading citizen and the most interesting personality among this
social population. Such was his place and so masterful as well
as constructive his influence that it was a true expression of
the feeling of all which one resident wrote at that time to
another: "The king is dead, the man on whom we unconsciously
leaned and whom none of us thought of disobeying,
though only his personality held us to allegiance, is gone from
us. And I for one feel that I have lost a dear friend."</p>

<p>These three illustrations will serve to indicate both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
kind of persons who have come of the Quaker Hill community,
and one of its tendencies. They illustrate also the spirit of the
community toward its leaders.</p>

<p>Personalities of the austere type, men and women of the
devotional side of Quakerism, may be cited in the cases of
<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>David Irish and <a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>Richard T. Osborn. The former was the
last minister of the Hicksite Society of Friends on the Hill.
His preaching covered the years of its separate existence, for
he was made a minister in 1831, three years after the Division,
and he died in 1884, at the age of ninety-two. One
year after his death the Meeting was formally "laid down,"
in Oblong Meeting House, and from a place of worship it
became a house of memories.</p>

<p>David Irish was austere. Believing that slavery was
wrong, "he made his protest against slavery by abstaining, so
far as possible, from the use of slave-products ... made
maple to take the place of cane sugar, and used nothing but
linen and woolen clothing (largely home-spun). This abstaining
he continued for himself and family until slavery
was abolished." Yet "he never felt free," continues his
daughter and biographer, "to join with anti-slavery societies
outside his own, believing that by so doing he might compromise
some of his testimonies." He welcomed in his home
the fugitive slave fleeing from the South, and "there must
never be any distinction made in the family on account of his
color; he sat at the same table and was treated as an equal."</p>

<p>David Irish was equally opposed to war, and to capital
punishment. He wrote, "testified" and "suffered" for these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
principles. "In the time of the Civil War he allowed his cattle
to be sold by the tax-collector, not feeling free to pay the
direct war-tax." His biographer enumerates further his hospitality,
his fondness for books, his humor, and mentions with
a pride characteristic of the Quaker that he "was often entrusted
with the settlement of estates, showing the esteem in
which his business capacity and integrity were held by the
community."</p>

<p>Richard T. Osborn was the Elder of the Orthodox branch
of the Friends during the same period, subsequent to the
Division, as that covered by David Irish's life. Born in 1816,
he was conversant as a child with the period of the Division.
The seceding members of the Meeting met in his father's
house and barn until the Orthodox Meeting House could be
erected on the land upon which, at his marriage in 1842, he
erected his house. Richard Osborn was "the head of his
family." Strong of will, austere, convinced, he lived in the
world of Robert Barclay and William Penn, and for years
never hesitated to rebuke young or old Quakers or "world's
people," whom he found violating "the principles of truth." A
summer boarder who played a violin upon his premises was
silenced, and the singing of a hymn in the Meeting House of
which he was Clerk was once sternly "testified against."</p>

<p>But Richard Osborn was kindly. He had a gentle and
appreciative humor; and about 1890 there come influences in
the presence of neighbors to whom he was strongly drawn,
as well as the constant presence in his house of boarders from
New York; so that his later years were spent in a mellower
interest in dogma, and an ever keener interest in the history
of Quakerism and of the community in which he lived. His
wife, Roby, was a Quakeress of rare sweetness and exquisite
gentleness of character. Together this strong, dominating
man and his gentle wife constituted an influence, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
lived, which held the community together, and disseminated
their principles more successfully than if he had been eloquent,
instead of terse, and she an evangelist instead of a meek and
demure Quakeress.</p>

<p>These persons were conspicuous examples of the best social
product of Quaker Hill. They were not famous, nor great.
Their philosophy was one of self-repression and required them
to reduce their lives and those of other men to mediocrity.
Quaker Hill taught and practiced the prevention of pauperism&mdash;and
the prevention of genius! The ideals of the place discouraged
higher education. The leading personages distinctly
opposed the offer of higher education to the young.</p>

<p>Therefore this community, which has been exceptionally
wealthy for one hundred and fifty years, has done nothing for
general education; and has not educated its own sons. As
noted above, no person born on Quaker Hill ever completed
the courses for a degree in college or university, and though
the community has had for a century families with aesthetic
and literary tastes, no member of the community has painted
a picture, written a song, or published a book.</p>

<p>The personages briefly described above are named for another
reason. Their deaths, with the deaths of certain others
whom they represent, have brought to an end the period of
Quaker Hill's history which I have called "The Mixed Community."
The others who with them made up this group were
Jedediah and Phoebe Irish Wanzer, Anne Hayes, Olive Toffey
Worden, and six other persons still living, of whom four are
past eighty years and two are very near one hundred years of
age. This group of persons were the center of that Mixed
Community. They possessed the actual authority which this
population always has required in its leaders. The piety, the
austerity, the forcefulness, the ownership of the land of greatest
value, and even the available wealth of the community,
were so largely possessed by this group that in the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
1890-1900, in which this group was still intact, its leadership
was such as to unite the community and consolidate the whole
population for whatever interests the leaders of this group
approved. Of that period it was said: "Everybody on Quaker
Hill goes to everything!"</p>

<p>With the death of those who have passed away in the
latter part of the period under study the power of initiative
has gone. New proposals are hushed. Variation is discouraged;
the rut of custom and convention is preferred. And a
subtle stifling air of the impossibility of all active purposes
pervades social and religious and business activity on the Hill.</p>

<p>Religiously speaking, attendance upon public services have
decreased by twenty per cent., while the Protestant population
has only decreased five per cent.</p>

<p>In business activity reference is made above to the fact that
the number of milk dairies has decreased from eighteen to
nine, a decrease of fifty per cent. At the same time the largest
dairy on the Hill which in the decade 1890-1900 "was milking
one hundred cows," has for the years 1903-1907 "made milk"
from only forty and fifty cows, although the owner has more
land than his predecessor.</p>

<p>The population which now remains on Quaker Hill contains
only a few persons of force and leadership, and they
are no longer so grouped as to command. The majority have
no ability to follow unless authority be an element in the leadership;
and authority to command the whole community has

<h2 class="chapter">VITA.</h2>


<p>The author of this dissertation was born May 1, 1867. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
received from Oberlin College the degree of A. B. in 1890, and
that of A. M. in 1894. He graduated from Union Theological
Seminary in 1894, and has since served as an active pastor at
Quaker Hill and in Brooklyn, New York. While in the
Seminary and also during the years 1903-1905 he was a
graduate student in Columbia University, having especial
interest in the lectures of Professor Franklin H. Giddings;
to whom as to his associates on the Faculty of Political Science,
he owes a debt of gratitude for a conception of the common
life of men on the earth.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>
<br />
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The oldest records of Oblong meeting are contained in the records of Purchase
Meeting, the mother society, from the earliest date, about 1741, at which
Oblong is mentioned, to 1744, when it became an independent monthly meeting.
Most of the early settlers on the Oblong came through Purchase, married there
and left their names on its pages. From the year 1744 Oblong Meeting was a
meeting of record, but for thirteen years the minutes were written on loose
sheets, which have been lost. They may indeed be in existence, for in 1760 the
meeting directs Clerk Zebulon Ferriss to record the minutes for the time he has
been clerk; and appoints two to record the previous minutes from the establishment
of the meeting. If those two did as they were directed, there should be a
book of the oldest records of the Hill in existence; and in any case there may be
in some old leather bound trunk, leaves of records from 1744 to 1757, whose value
is beyond calculation. The minutes of the Meeting from 1757 until the division,
and from that date until the Hicksite Meeting was laid down in 1885, are in the
possession of John Cox, Librarian of the Yearly Meeting (Hicksite). From 1828,
the year of the division, until the present year, the minutes of the Orthodox
Friends are in the possession of William H. Osborn. The minutes of the Women's
Meeting previous to 1807 are missing; one volume, from 9th Mo., 14th, 1807, to
3rd Mo., 16th, 1835, is with John Cox. In the same place are three volumes of
the record of Births, Marriages and Deaths: one from 1745 to 1774; then, after a
gap, due to the absence of a volume, is the second, from 1786 to 1866; and a
third volume of births and deaths alone from 1828 to 1893. Volumes lacking in this
collection are the records of births and deaths previous to 1828: and of marriages
from 1774 to 1786.
</p><p>
The records of the present Orthodox Meeting in full, as well as the following
two volumes of the records of the Preparative Meeting of Ministers and Elders at
Oblong, are in the possession of William H. Osborn on Quaker Hill; first from
10th month, 12th, 1783, to 1st month, 13th, 1878; and second from 1878 to present
time. Last of all, the record of births and deaths of the meeting, from 1810 to the
present day, following the line of the Orthodox society, is in the possession of
the Post family on Quaker Hill.</p></div>

Oblong:
</p>

<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: -1em;"><p>
The eastern side of the country had been settled by Presbyterians from Connecticut,
and the western side along the Hudson River by the Dutch. The feeling
between them was far from friendly. Their disputes had been very bitter, and Rye
and Bedford had revolted from New York's jurisdiction. Their whipping-posts
stood ready for the punishment of any from the river settlements who committed
even slight offenses within their limits. As the two peoples naturally repelled each
other they had left a strip of land, comparatively unoccupied, between them. This
continued in nearly a north and south line, parallel with the river, and a little
more than midway between it and the Connecticut and Massachusetts lines, as far
as they extended. Into and through the strip of land the Quaker stream flowed,
like a liquid injected into a fissure in the rocks. Each Quaker home as it settled
became a resting place for those who followed, for it was a cardinal principle of
Quaker hospitality to keep open house for all fellow members, under all
circumstances.</p></div></div>


<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> "One First Day morning, in the mellow October days of that year, the
worshipping stillness of the Friends' Meeting was broken by the tramp of horses,
and the jangling of spurs, as a band of soldiers rode up, dismounted and entered
the building. They remained quiet and reverent, till the handshaking of the elders
closed the meeting; then the commanding officer rose, and in the name of the
Continental Congress took possession of the building for a hospital for the troops,
and as such it was used all that winter. After this meetings were held in the
'great room' in the house of Paul Osborn, and were often frequented by soldiers
stationed in the place, who listened attentively to the speaking, and left quietly at
the close of the meeting."&mdash;Richard Osborn&mdash;a Reminiscence, by Margaret B.
Monahan, Quaker Hill Local History Series, No. VIII.</p></div>

were discovered by the present writer.</p></div>

from the skin and lungs rapid. That weak persons whose variations of
health furnish good tests, are worse when the air is surcharged with water, and
better when the weather is fine; and that commonly such persons are enervated by
residence in moist localities but invigorated by residence in dry ones, are facts
generally recognized. And this relation of cause and effect, manifest in individuals,
doubtless holds in races."&mdash;Herbert Spencer, Principles of Sociology, Vol. I, p. 21.</p></div>

of the Society of Friends: "The central point of his doctrine is the direct responsibility
of each soul to God, without mediation of priest or form, because of the
presence of the Holy Spirit in the heart of every human being." Johnson's Universal
Cyclopedia, 1894.
</p><p>
The following is authoritative for the Society: "We believe in no principle of
life, light or holiness, but the influence of the Holy Spirit of God, bestowed on
mankind, in various measures and degrees, through Jesus Christ our Lord. It is
the capacity to receive this blessed influence, which, in an especial manner, gives
man pre-eminence above the beasts that perish; which distinguishes him, in every
nation and in every clime, as an object of the redeeming love of God; as a being
not only intelligent but responsible;..."&mdash;"A Declaration of Some of the
Fundamental Doctrines of Christian Truth, as held by the Religious Society of
Friends."</p></div>

swung wide. Paul Osborn kept open house for "his friends, the people called
Quakers," during his lifetime, and his will provides in the most minute and careful
manner for his wife "the better to qualifye her to keep a house of entertainment
for friends." ... The "littel meadow in lot 29" he gave to Isaac Osborn, that
"he shall keep well all horses of friends my wife shall send him;" and should
Isaac "neglect the injunctions herein enjoined," and cease to keep such house of
entertainment for friends then his right to certain legacies "shall descend and
revolve to them, him or her that shall truly fulfill them." All his lands in the
latter case Paul gives to the "Yearly Meeting for Friends, the people called
Quakers, of Philadelphia."&mdash;"Richard Osborn, a Reminiscence," by Margaret B.

was crowded. The young people took their places upon the facing seats, and the
meeting began. Daniel Haviland was minister and he spoke at length. Then, after
a short pause, Richard Osborn and Roby Hoag arose, and clasping hands, spoke
alternately the solemn sentences of the Friends' marriage ceremony, which have
united them for sixty years. Then was brought forth the marriage certificate,
fairly engrossed in the bridegroom's own hand, and many names of those present
were affixed, after which it was read aloud. This being done, and kindly greetings
offered, Richard and Roby Osborn drove back to their home. The wedding
was well furnished with guests, and four fat turkeys graced the board that day."&mdash;"Richard

Service after his death in 1903, is of interest here, as showing the influence of
persons upon him who were not of Quaker Hill ancestry or of Quaker breeding:
</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
<p>
"In all the years he lived on the Hill he had to do with every movement and
was in touch with every person on the Hill. He made himself a party to every
public interest. When the building of the Hotel was suggested, he put himself at
the head of the movement, invested the most money in it, and later obtaining entire
control, deeded it to his Akin Hall foundation. When the library enterprise was
broached, which has grown into Akin Free Library, he organized and incorporated
the institution required, endowed it generously; later reorganized it, upon legal
advice; thus accepting ideas from Admiral Worden, William B. Wheeler, Cyrus
Swan, Judge Barnard, and others of his neighbors, and contributing his own patient
and unflagging executive faculty. When it was thought best, in 1892, to continue
the church services throughout the winter under the leadership of Mrs. Wheeler
and of Miss Monahan, and the growth of the Sunday school and permanent congregation
seemed to require the employment of a resident pastor, Mr. Akin acquiesced;
at first as a follower, but steadily and increasingly as a leader, he identified
himself more and more every year until his death, with the religious life of
Akin Hall and Christ's Church. He was a good leader, for he confessed himself
a follower in the enterprise which he was in a position absolutely to control. He
eagerly availed himself of the suggestions of others, took a quiet and lowly place
with entire dignity, and exerted without arbitrariness a determining influence.
</p><p>
"When Mr. Akin was about sixty years of age, he bought a residence in New
York, and went there to live in the winters. He had as a neighbor a Quaker
preacher named Wright, who was accustomed to come to Oblong Meeting in the
course of the year. With him Mr. Akin had many conversations on matters of
duty and worship.
</p><p>
"He began also to attend the Oblong Meeting in the summer, though the Sunday
meetings were not at that time largely attended.
</p><p>
"Later when his residence was at Fifty-sixth Street he became the fast
friend and devoted admirer of Dr. John Hall, who used often to call upon him.
For years Mr. Akin was carried into Dr. Hall's Church; but after Dr. Hall died,
and even before, he had ceased from that custom.
</p><p>
"The growth of the church on Quaker Hill, under the leadership of Mr. and
Mrs. William B. Wheeler and Miss Margaret B. Monahan took strong hold on Mr.
Akin's heart, and exerted over no one a more vital influence than on this old man."&mdash;Albert
J. Akin&mdash;A Tribute, by Rev. Warren H. Wilson, Quaker Hill Conference,
1903.</p></div></div>
